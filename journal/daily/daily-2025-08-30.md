# Daily Check-in: 2025-08-30

## ðŸŒ™ Evening Check-in (23:13)
**Overall Day Feeling:** 5/10 - Worked on fixing up nvim but felt stuck with it, though got it working with Obsidian and Syncthing

**Today's Accomplishments:**
1. Got nvim working with Obsidian and Syncthing integration
2. Completed 1 hour of boot.dev practice (maintaining streak!)
3. Continued terminal workflow setup and configuration

**Tomorrow's Priority:** Keep momentum up, get back to AI development - possibly fix Project Manager or ClaudeLife TaskMaster with Google Calendar integration for better planning system

**End Energy Level:** 6/10

**Challenges/Blockers:** Life happens - getting tired, children distracting and causing stress, tunnel vision focusing on low value tasks

**Gratitude:** Grateful for using Linux instead of Windows

**Reflections:** Got stuck in nvim configuration but made progress. Need to balance deep technical work with higher-level AI development goals. Recognizing the pattern of getting tunnel vision on low-value tasks is important self-awareness.
