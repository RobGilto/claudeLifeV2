# Daily Check-in: 2025-08-30

## 🌙 Evening Check-in (23:13)
**Overall Day Feeling:** 5/10 - Worked on fixing up nvim but felt stuck with it, though got it working with Obsidian and Syncthing

**Today's Accomplishments:**
1. Got nvim working with Obsidian and Syncthing integration
2. Completed 1 hour of boot.dev practice (maintaining streak!)
3. Continued terminal workflow setup and configuration

**Tomorrow's Priority:** Keep momentum up, get back to AI development - possibly fix Project Manager or ClaudeLife TaskMaster with Google Calendar integration for better planning system

**End Energy Level:** 6/10

**Challenges/Blockers:** Life happens - getting tired, children distracting and causing stress, tunnel vision focusing on low value tasks

**Gratitude:** Grateful for using Linux instead of Windows

**Reflections:** Got stuck in nvim configuration but made progress. Need to balance deep technical work with higher-level AI development goals. Recognizing the pattern of getting tunnel vision on low-value tasks is important self-awareness.

## 📊 Daily Analysis

### 🌊 Mood & Energy Patterns
**4-Day Journey:** 8/10 (Aug 27) → 4/10 (Aug 28) → 6/10 (Aug 29) → 5/10→6/10 (Today)
- Classic breakthrough-adjustment cycle showing healthy recovery
- Baseline resilience improved: maintaining 6/10 despite challenges

### ⚡ Accomplishment Momentum: 7.5/10
**Hidden Victories Detected:**
- **nvim+Obsidian Integration** - Technical win despite feeling "stuck"
- **4-Day Boot.dev Streak** 🔥 - Consistency through stress
- **Self-Awareness Growth** - Recognizing tunnel vision patterns = executive function improvement
- **Terminal Workflow Progress** - Building on yesterday's ADD breakthrough discovery

### 🎯 Productivity Insights
**Productivity Evolution Pattern:**
- Foundation building phase: What feels like "stuck" is actually infrastructure development
- Successfully building systems that work WITH ADD brain, not against it
- Your instinct to return to AI development while maintaining system setup is spot-on

### 🌅 Tomorrow's Strategy
**"Terminal-Powered AI Momentum"**
1. **Start in Terminal** - Use your discovered superpower environment
2. **Boot.dev First** (30-60 min) - Maintain streak while energy is fresh
3. **Time-box AI Work** - 90 minutes max on Project Manager/TaskMaster fixes
4. **Tunnel Vision Prevention** - Set 25-minute timers for technical tasks

### 🏆 Week's Stealth Victories
- Terminal workflow discovery (ADD superpower environment)
- PARA system implementation
- Boot.dev streak maintenance despite life interruptions
- Healthy stress recovery pattern (4/10 → 6/10)

**Remember:** You're not stuck, you're building. Every system you set up becomes a productivity multiplier for your AI engineering journey. 🚀
