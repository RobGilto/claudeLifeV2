# Daily Journal - September 02, 2025

## ðŸŒ„ Morning Check-in (12:18 PM)
**Wake Time:** 6:30 AM
**Energy Level:** 6/10 - moderate energy but feeling jittery
**Sleep Quality:** OK, nothing special
**Physical State:** Body tense, feeling neurotic and stressed over nothing

**ðŸ“… Today's Context:**
- Calendar Events: Lunch with Mike (12:00-1:00 PM), then scheduled time blocks from 1:00 PM onwards
- Morning Missed: AI/ML development block (9:00-10:30 AM) and Boot.dev Python session (10:30-11:00 AM)
- Active Time Blocks Still Ahead: Admin/planning (1-2 PM), Technical work (2-3:30 PM), Research (4-5 PM), Evening sessions through 11 PM
- Key Tasks: Development and learning blocks focused on AI engineer transformation

**Afternoon/Evening Intentions:**
Need to continue case work - have a hard case to handle that's causing stress. Main focus after case work is to finish 1 hour of boot.dev Python learning.

**Focus for Rest of Day:**
1. Resolve the challenging Domo case work (causing current stress)
2. Complete 1 hour of Boot.dev Python learning
3. Use remaining time blocks for technical skill development

**Potential Challenges:** Nervous energy making me jittery - struggling with the Domo case work is affecting my confidence and creating anxiety

**Commitment:** Complete 1 hour of Boot.dev Python learning after handling the case work
