# Daily Journal - September 02, 2025

## ðŸŒ„ Morning Check-in (12:18 PM)
**Wake Time:** 6:30 AM
**Energy Level:** 6/10 - moderate energy but feeling jittery
**Sleep Quality:** OK, nothing special
**Physical State:** Body tense, feeling neurotic and stressed over nothing

**ðŸ“… Today's Context:**
- Calendar Events: Lunch with Mike (12:00-1:00 PM), then scheduled time blocks from 1:00 PM onwards
- Morning Missed: AI/ML development block (9:00-10:30 AM) and Boot.dev Python session (10:30-11:00 AM)
- Active Time Blocks Still Ahead: Admin/planning (1-2 PM), Technical work (2-3:30 PM), Research (4-5 PM), Evening sessions through 11 PM
- Key Tasks: Development and learning blocks focused on AI engineer transformation

**Afternoon/Evening Intentions:**
Need to continue case work - have a hard case to handle that's causing stress. Main focus after case work is to finish 1 hour of boot.dev Python learning.

**Focus for Rest of Day:**
1. Resolve the challenging Domo case work (causing current stress)
2. Complete 1 hour of Boot.dev Python learning
3. Use remaining time blocks for technical skill development

**Potential Challenges:** Nervous energy making me jittery - struggling with the Domo case work is affecting my confidence and creating anxiety

**Commitment:** Complete 1 hour of Boot.dev Python learning after handling the case work

## ðŸŒ… Afternoon Check-in (6:26 PM)
**Current Energy:** 7/10 (improved from morning 6/10)
**Afternoon Satisfaction:** Not as productive due to family priorities
**Key Accomplishments:**
- âœ… Progressed and resolved the challenging Domo case work
- âœ… Resolved an additional Domo case as well  
- âœ… Completed Boot.dev Python learning session (1 hour commitment fulfilled)
- âœ… Took son to doctor for leg results check (family priority)

**What Worked Well:** Energy management - recognizing when body was stressed and taking strategic rest in bed to gather energy before returning to focused case work

**Challenges Faced:** Body feeling stressed and overwhelmed today, leading to need for rest period

**Self-Care Strategy:** Listened to body's signals - rested in bed when overwhelmed, then got up with renewed focus for case work

**Wins/Breakthroughs:** 
- Successfully managed stress through strategic rest
- Fulfilled Boot.dev commitment despite challenging day
- Resolved TWO Domo cases including the difficult one causing morning stress
- Balanced family responsibilities (son's doctor visit) with work commitments

**Evening Outlook:** Currently in 6:00-7:30 PM evening project work block

**ðŸ“… Afternoon Plan Review:**
- 2:00-3:30 PM Technical work: Partially completed (family doctor visit took priority)
- 4:00-5:00 PM Research/skill practice: Completed Boot.dev Python learning âœ…
- Current: 6:00-7:30 PM Evening project work (in progress)
- TaskWarrior tasks: Multiple development blocks progressed, case work resolved

## ðŸŒ™ Evening Check-in (11:26 PM)
**Overall Day Feeling:** 3/10 - Feeling low, scattered, and discouraged. Not my best day mentally but stayed honest to myself.

**Today's Accomplishments:**
1. Kept Boot.dev learning streak alive with Python session
2. Started exploring "AI Native Engineer" videos and downloaded Claude Code repo for learning
3. Got quality family time - campfire and swimming with the kids

**Tomorrow's Priority:** Keep the momentum going and try the time blocking system again with better mood/energy

**End Energy Level:** 3/10

**Challenges/Blockers:** 
- System trust issues - struggling to follow the time block structure, most blocks weren't kept today
- Need clearer executive instructions in time blocks so I know exactly what to do
- Plans change quickly when work gets missed, hoping buffer time helps
- Want to export executive functioning to Claude Code but need blocks aligned to mission

**Gratitude:** Grateful for quality time with kids (swimming, campfire) and minimal family drama

**Planning Insights:** 
Realized plans change rapidly when work gets missed. Time blocks weren't productive in evening but I stayed honest - didn't doom scroll, just had low energy. Need system tweaks but willing to keep trying.

**Reflections:** 
Had a hiccup that stressed me more than it should have. Hope tomorrow brings better mood for clearer feedback on the day planner system. Want time blocks with clear enough executive instructions so I know what I'm doing and it aligns with my mission.

**ðŸ“… Today's Execution Review:**
- Planned time blocks: 7 blocks scheduled, morning block missed, evening blocks low productivity but stayed engaged
- Key objectives: Technical progress (partial), documentation (started), momentum maintenance (achieved through Boot.dev)
- TaskWarrior tasks: Development blocks progressed despite challenges, case work stress resolved
