# Daily Journal - September 02, 2025

## ðŸŒ„ Morning Check-in (12:18 PM)
**Wake Time:** 6:30 AM
**Energy Level:** 6/10 - moderate energy but feeling jittery
**Sleep Quality:** OK, nothing special
**Physical State:** Body tense, feeling neurotic and stressed over nothing

**ðŸ“… Today's Context:**
- Calendar Events: Lunch with Mike (12:00-1:00 PM), then scheduled time blocks from 1:00 PM onwards
- Morning Missed: AI/ML development block (9:00-10:30 AM) and Boot.dev Python session (10:30-11:00 AM)
- Active Time Blocks Still Ahead: Admin/planning (1-2 PM), Technical work (2-3:30 PM), Research (4-5 PM), Evening sessions through 11 PM
- Key Tasks: Development and learning blocks focused on AI engineer transformation

**Afternoon/Evening Intentions:**
Need to continue case work - have a hard case to handle that's causing stress. Main focus after case work is to finish 1 hour of boot.dev Python learning.

**Focus for Rest of Day:**
1. Resolve the challenging Domo case work (causing current stress)
2. Complete 1 hour of Boot.dev Python learning
3. Use remaining time blocks for technical skill development

**Potential Challenges:** Nervous energy making me jittery - struggling with the Domo case work is affecting my confidence and creating anxiety

**Commitment:** Complete 1 hour of Boot.dev Python learning after handling the case work

## ðŸŒ… Afternoon Check-in (6:26 PM)
**Current Energy:** 7/10 (improved from morning 6/10)
**Afternoon Satisfaction:** Not as productive due to family priorities
**Key Accomplishments:**
- âœ… Progressed and resolved the challenging Domo case work
- âœ… Resolved an additional Domo case as well  
- âœ… Completed Boot.dev Python learning session (1 hour commitment fulfilled)
- âœ… Took son to doctor for leg results check (family priority)

**What Worked Well:** Energy management - recognizing when body was stressed and taking strategic rest in bed to gather energy before returning to focused case work

**Challenges Faced:** Body feeling stressed and overwhelmed today, leading to need for rest period

**Self-Care Strategy:** Listened to body's signals - rested in bed when overwhelmed, then got up with renewed focus for case work

**Wins/Breakthroughs:** 
- Successfully managed stress through strategic rest
- Fulfilled Boot.dev commitment despite challenging day
- Resolved TWO Domo cases including the difficult one causing morning stress
- Balanced family responsibilities (son's doctor visit) with work commitments

**Evening Outlook:** Currently in 6:00-7:30 PM evening project work block

**ðŸ“… Afternoon Plan Review:**
- 2:00-3:30 PM Technical work: Partially completed (family doctor visit took priority)
- 4:00-5:00 PM Research/skill practice: Completed Boot.dev Python learning âœ…
- Current: 6:00-7:30 PM Evening project work (in progress)
- TaskWarrior tasks: Multiple development blocks progressed, case work resolved
