# Daily Check-in: 2025-08-25

## Feeling: 6/10
Slightly positive but body is sore

## Accomplishments
1. **Created a script to help customer process 37,000 items** - Built bulk processing automation with Claude Code
2. **Engineered staged approach** - Designed the work to be broken down into manageable stages that can run step-by-step  
3. **Added extra walk around the oval** - While walking dog to bus stop with kids, decided to incrementally increase steps

## Tomorrow's Priority
Improve the templates feature for my project manager to add GitHub linking into Claude Code. Want to explore improving coding quality by adding strong rules, good coding standards, and using Hooks for scaffolding/reminders.

## Energy Level: 5/10
Body is overweight and sore, brain is spent. Considering adding a power nap around noon as a core ritual to regain energy.

## Challenges/Blockers
No blockers today, only feeling tired/lethargic

## Gratitude
Grateful that I'll be paying off my HECS once 20% is discounted and Hedera goes up to 50K USD - will track it daily

## Additional Reflections
- Walked the dog as usual but decided to walk around the oval for an extra round - good incremental progress
- Made a meal plan with wife: only shakes as meal replacement except Saturday (in-laws), Sunday (McDonald's with Dad), Monday & Friday (work lunches)
