# Daily Journal - September 03, 2025

## üåô Evening Check-in (23:37)
**Overall Day Feeling:** 7/10 - feeling ok

**Today's Accomplishments:**
1. Added boot.dev training challenge system
2. Improved skill checking functionality  
3. Completed boot.dev day streak which also completed one of the python courses
4. Improved the ritual system and tested it
5. Added a recommender system to help manage slash command recommendations

**Time Block Performance:** Time blocks did not go as well - case work took over the day. Need to shift some work to after tomorrow.

**Tomorrow's Priority:** Keep the boot.dev linux streak, revisit some python concepts in the challenge sections. Definitely will walk the dog tomorrow and maybe walk around the oval a second time.

**End Energy Level:** 6/10

**Challenges/Blockers:** Work got busy, and I think my role is becoming redundant, so will need to start preparing the resume (new project)

**Gratitude:** I am grateful I started a campfire and hanged with my kids today. I am grateful I am not nutting and keep abstinence.

**Planning Insights:** My block times are not working as effectively, but I will keep at it until it sticks.

**üìÖ Today's Execution Review:**
- **Planned time blocks:** 6 blocks (4.5h deep work, 1.5h learning, 1.5h admin) - execution disrupted by work demands
- **Key objectives:** 
  - Technical progress ‚úì (boot.dev streak, skill systems)
  - Document learnings ‚úì (system improvements)
  - ADD-friendly structure ‚ö†Ô∏è (blocks disrupted but persistence maintained)
- **TaskWarrior tasks:** Multiple development time blocks pending due to work interference
