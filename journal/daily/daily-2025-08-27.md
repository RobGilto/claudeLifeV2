# Daily Check-in - August 27, 2025

## ðŸŒ™ Evening Check-in (19:47)

**Overall Day Feeling:** 8/10 - Getting excited! I'm slowly getting traction in the right places with AI Engineer Launchpad (Skool.com/ai-engineer/classroom) and Boot.dev. Understanding the direction I need for skill acquisition and certification acquisition.

**Today's Accomplishments:**
1. Built a CLI application 
2. Reinstalled laptop to Linux Mint so I can run when not on my computer
3. Did Boot.dev Python for an hour (refreshing!)
4. Read about certification paths (encouraging - recruiters will know I'm skilled)
5. Added TaskWarrior and TaskWarrior MCP to claudeLife repo for task management organization

**Tomorrow's Priority:** Work more on building Python skills and tweak TaskWarrior with supplementing a strategic Task Manager for AI engineering phases, managing week-by-week tasks with strategic emphasis.

**End Energy Level:** 8/10

**Challenges/Blockers:** Tiredness, but evening nap helped

**Gratitude:** 
- I have capital to buy resources
- I'm on this AI engineering journey  
- Excited about the future

**Reflections:** 
Interesting to see how my AI development progresses through Python Boot.dev - already feeling a good tingle about it. The way forward will have ups and downs, but if I rewire my brain into sharp laser focus, an AI Ninja, I will find interesting things. 

Important reminder: My energy vampiric self, my mimic, is never to be forgotten. "I love you mimic, you are my family, I will take your consideration, you mean well, I got it from here."
