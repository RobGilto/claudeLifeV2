# Daily Check-in - Friday, August 23, 2025

## Responses

**1. How are you feeling today? (1-10 + brief description)**
2/10 - Feeling overwhelmed, my body is tired, I am overeating due to stress and trying to catch up with AI. Saturdays I do house gardening and outdoor projects at 9-11, and I feel that because I don't take well to physical labour, it sets me up for failure. I am tired, and my resolve is weak.

**2. What are 3 things you accomplished today? (big or small)**
Nothing AI.

**3. What's your #1 priority for tomorrow?**
I don't have any priorities

**4. Energy level: (1-10)**
4

**5. Any challenges or blockers you faced today?**
My physical fitness to recover from house work. My ADHD daughter who has boundry issues.

**6. What are you grateful for today?**
I made a decision to pay off my hecs and my wife's hecs so I can earn $300 extra for AI expenses per month.

**7. Any other thoughts or reflections? (This is your space - ADD rabbit holes welcome!)**
I feel discouraged, unmotivated, and lack leadership.

## Context Notes
- Physical exhaustion from house work affecting mental energy
- Family stress with ADHD daughter and boundary issues
- Zero AI progress today creating guilt/pressure
- Positive financial decision made (HECS payoff = $300/month extra for AI expenses)
- Weekend physical tasks (gardening 9-11am) creating anxiety about failure
- Stress eating cycle active
- Feeling lack of direction and leadership in own life
