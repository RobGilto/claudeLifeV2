# Daily Check-in - August 31, 2025

## ðŸŒ™ Evening Check-in (23:20)
**Overall Day Feeling:** 4/10 - today I feel bad, I feel like a fool, my mind struggles to think constructively

**Today's Accomplishments:**
1. Continued my streak in boot.dev 
2. Got Google MCP working on ClaudeLife using user profile and documented how to do it so I can replicate again
3. [Third accomplishment not specified]

**Tomorrow's Priority:** I want to maintain the streak, but I also want to start on the AI engineer course

**End Energy Level:** 7/10 - I have slept in the afternoon so I am ok

**Challenges/Blockers:** I am struggling to build a system from scratch, my thoughts fizzle out when I am trying to rebuild claudeLife V3

**Gratitude:** I am grateful I saw my Dad today, I am grateful I use Github to reverse bad vibe codes

**Reflections:** I am concerned with my time management, I feel I am not accomplishing much in my family environment
