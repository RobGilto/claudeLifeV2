- **Community Engagement**: Weekly AI Engineer Launchpad participation established
- **Terminal Productivity**: Workflow optimization documented and systematized

## Resource Requirements

### Financial Investment
- **Azure AI Engineer Associate certification**: $165 USD (from HECS payoff savings)
- **Azure Data Scientist Associate certification**: $135 USD (optional Q4 target)
- **Learning resources**: Boot.dev subscription and community access maintained

### Time Allocation
- **Daily Practice**: 2-3 hours technical work (Boot.dev, portfolio, certification prep)
- **Weekly Community**: 1 hour AI Engineer Launchpad engagement  
- **Weekend Project Work**: 4-6 hours intensive portfolio development
- **Administrative**: 30 minutes daily planning/review maintenance

### Energy Management
- **High Energy Days (8-9/10)**: Structured time blocks for complex portfolio work
- **Medium Energy Days (6-7/10)**: Certification study and Boot.dev practice
- **Low Energy Days (4-5/10)**: Adaptive workflow with community engagement and documentation
- **Terminal Environment**: Leverage ADD superpower discovery for distraction-free focus

### Support Systems
- **AI Engineer Launchpad community**: Strategic networking and learning opportunities
- **Boot.dev structured learning**: Consistent foundation building with gamification
