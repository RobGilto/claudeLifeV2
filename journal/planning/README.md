- `monthly-reviews/plan-YYYY-MM.md` - Monthly objectives plan
- `quarterly-reviews/plan-YYYY-Qq.md` - Quarterly strategic plan
- `mission-statements/plan-YYYY.md` - Yearly vision and mission

### Reviews (Generated by review commands)

- `weekly-reviews/review-YYYY-Www.md` - Weekly performance analysis
- `monthly-reviews/review-YYYY-MM.md` - Monthly achievement review
- `quarterly-reviews/review-YYYY-Qq.md` - Quarterly strategic review

## Integration with Fractal Planning System

### Data Flow
- Raw planning data stored in `planning/data/` (JSON files)
- Human-readable reports generated here (Markdown files)
- Performance analytics in `planning/analytics/` (exports)

### Command Integration
All slash commands generate both:
1. Machine data for analysis (`planning/data/`)
2. Human-readable reports for review (`journal/planning/`)

### Relationship to Other Journal Directories
- `journal/daily/` - Daily check-ins (enhanced with plan progress)
- `journal/brain/` - Brain dumps and analysis
- `journal/planning/` - Strategic planning reports (this directory)

## Review Workflow

1. **Plan** → Generate plan report in appropriate subdirectory
2. **Execute** → Track via taskmaster with performance data
3. **Review** → Generate review report with insights and adjustments  
4. **Analyze** → Create comparison and trend reports for strategic learning
5. **Adjust** → Update plans based on review insights

This creates a complete feedback loop for continuous improvement in fractal planning effectiveness.
