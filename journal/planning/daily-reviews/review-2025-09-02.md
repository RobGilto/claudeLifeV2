# Daily Review: 2025-09-02

## Execution Summary
- Time blocks completed: 4/7 (partial completion on several)
- Objectives achieved: 2/3 (technical progress partial, momentum maintained) 
- Overall completion rate: 60%

## Time Block Analysis
- **Morning Block (9:00-10:30)**: ‚ùå Missed due to late start
- **Admin Block (11:00-12:00)**: ‚úÖ Adjusted around lunch with Mike
- **Technical Work (14:00-15:30)**: üîÑ Partially completed (family doctor visit priority)
- **Research Block (16:00-17:00)**: ‚úÖ Completed Boot.dev Python learning
- **Evening Blocks (18:00-23:00)**: üîÑ Low productivity but stayed engaged
- **Family Priorities**: ‚úÖ Doctor visit and quality time (campfire/swimming)

## Energy & Focus Patterns
- Morning energy: 6/10 (jittery, stressed about case work)
- Afternoon energy: 7/10 (improved after strategic rest)
- Evening energy: 3/10 (crashed, scattered, discouraged)
- Average focus: 6/10
- Best performance time: 2:00-5:00 PM (after stress resolution)

## Newport Slow Productivity Assessment

### Deep Work Quality
- **Deep Work Hours Today**: 2.5 hours (Boot.dev session + case work focus)
- **Deep Work Effectiveness**: 7/10 (effective when engaged despite stress)
- **Interruption Count**: 3 interruptions (family priorities, stress management)
- **Context Switches**: 5 times (case work ‚Üí family ‚Üí learning ‚Üí relaxation)

### Quality Over Quantity
- **Craft Focus**: Resolved two challenging Domo cases thoroughly rather than rushing
- **Standards Maintained**: Maintained Boot.dev learning commitment despite challenges
- **Perfectionism Check**: Good balance - addressed stress without compromising standards
- **Meaningful Progress**: Started AI Native Engineer exploration, repo learning initiated

### Sustainable Pace Check
- **Overcommitment Score**: 4/10 (reasonable commitments, stress from complexity not volume)
- **Recovery Time**: 3+ hours including strategic rest + family time
- **Energy Management**: Excellent - used strategic rest for afternoon recovery
- **Tomorrow's Sustainability**: Sustainable with better stress management

### Values Expression Today
- **Primary Value Lived**: Growth through challenge (handled difficult cases + learning)
- **Values Alignment**: Family time, learning commitment, professional competence
- **Values Neglected**: Self-compassion during low energy evening period

## Accomplishments & Wins
- ‚úÖ Resolved TWO challenging Domo cases (including morning stressor)
- ‚úÖ Maintained Boot.dev learning streak with Python session
- ‚úÖ Started exploring AI Native Engineer videos and Claude Code repo
- ‚úÖ Successfully managed family priority (son's doctor visit)  
- ‚úÖ Quality family connection time (campfire and swimming)
- ‚úÖ Strategic stress management through afternoon rest
- ‚úÖ Stayed honest during low energy (avoided doom scrolling)

## Challenges & Learning
- **Stress Management**: Morning case work stress affected overall day energy
- **Time Block Adherence**: System needs clearer executive instructions for ADD brain
- **Energy Crashes**: Afternoon recovery followed by evening crash - pattern to optimize
- **System Feedback**: Generated valuable insights about executive function needs

## Alignment Assessment  
- **Weekly goal support**: Technical progress maintained, learning streak continued
- **Monthly objective connection**: AI engineering skill development through Boot.dev and exploration
- **Mission alignment**: Steps toward 2026 AI engineer transformation goal

## Tomorrow's Planning
- **Top priority**: Maintain momentum with improved mood/energy for system feedback
- **Energy optimization**: Schedule demanding work during 10 AM - 3 PM window
- **Lessons applied**: 
  - Include strategic rest as legitimate time block option
  - Add clearer executive instructions to time blocks
  - Build buffer time for rapid plan changes
  - Start with energy assessment to adjust block difficulty

## Performance Insights
**Key Pattern**: Stress-Recovery-Crash cycle (6‚Üí7‚Üí3 energy levels) shows excellent stress management skills but needs evening energy preservation strategies.

**System Evolution**: Today's "struggles" provided valuable data for improving ADD-friendly executive function support. The time blocking system is evolving, not failing.

**Victory Disconnect**: Subjective feeling (3/10) doesn't match objective performance (8/10 accomplishment score). Need to celebrate wins in real-time to prevent evening mood crashes.

**Strategic Strength**: Ability to maintain learning commitments and professional competence during stressful periods demonstrates resilience crucial for AI engineering transition.
