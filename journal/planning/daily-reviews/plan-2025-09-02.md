## Daily Objectives (Max 3 for focus)

1. **Complete meaningful technical progress** - Priority 1
   - *Alignment:* 2026 AI engineer transformation
   - *Focus:* Python Boot.dev training and portfolio project advancement

2. **Document learnings and capture victories** - Priority 2  
   - *Alignment:* Knowledge retention and confidence building
   - *Focus:* Victory tracking and insight capture

3. **Maintain momentum with ADD-friendly structure** - Priority 3
   - *Alignment:* Sustainable daily practice
   - *Focus:* Consistent execution with clear time blocks

## Parent Alignment Context

### Week 36 Priorities (Python Foundation Week)
- **Primary:** Focus on Python Boot.dev training (prerequisite for Azure certification)
- **Secondary:** Begin portfolio project MVP development (Due Sept 15)
- **Critical:** Document August breakthrough patterns (Due Sept 7)

### September Goals (Professional Demonstration)
- **M09-1:** Deliver demonstrable portfolio project milestone by September 15
- **M09-2:** Complete Azure AI Engineer certification preparation by Sept 30
- **M09-3:** Establish systematic Boot.dev practice consistency (7/7 daily target)

### Daily Context
- **Theme:** Technical Excellence & Structured Learning
- **Energy Pattern:** Morning focus on deep work, afternoon on application and review
- **ADD Constraints:** Max 90min blocks with clear transitions

## Integration & Execution

### TaskWarrior Integration âœ…
- **7 time block tasks created** and ready for execution
- Use `/task-list` to view pending tasks
- Mark complete with `/task-done [task-id]`

### Calendar Sync Available ðŸ“…
- **7 calendar events prepared** for Google Calendar MCP
- MCP commands saved in: `planning/analytics/calendar-sync-2025-09-02.json`
- Use `/calendar-sync 2025-09-02` for automated sync

### Next Steps
- **Start execution:** `/taskmaster-start` 
- **Daily check-in:** `/morning-checkin` for energy assessment
- **Parent alignment:** All time blocks support W36 Python focus and September goals

## Notes

**Strategic Focus:** This plan prioritizes Python prerequisite training (W36) while maintaining portfolio project momentum for the Sept 15 milestone. The 9.5-hour total includes 4.5 hours of deep work aligned with AI engineering transformation goals.

**Adaptive Elements:** Time blocks can be adjusted based on energy patterns and family commitments, with 60-90 minute maximums respecting ADD optimization principles.
