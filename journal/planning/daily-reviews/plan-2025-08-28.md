## üéØ Daily Objectives (Max 3 for Focus)

1. **Complete meaningful technical progress**
   - Priority: HIGH
   - Links to: 2026 AI engineer transformation goal

2. **Document learnings and capture victories**
   - Priority: MEDIUM
   - Links to: Knowledge retention and confidence building

3. **Maintain momentum with ADD-friendly structure**
   - Priority: MEDIUM
   - Links to: Sustainable daily practice

## üîó Parent Alignment Context

### Strategic Themes
- **Quarter Focus**: Building technical foundations for AI career transition
- **Month Theme**: Systematic skill development and portfolio building
- **Week Priority**: Maintaining learning momentum and documentation habits

### Connection to Higher Goals
- Each deep work block directly supports the 2026 AI engineer transformation
- Balances technical learning (3.5 hrs) with application and reflection (2 hrs)
- Maintains ADD-friendly structure with clear transitions and variety

## üìù Planning Notes

### Energy Management
- Morning blocks (1-2): High cognitive load for deep technical work
- Afternoon blocks (3-4): Application, practice, and lighter learning
- Final block (5): Low energy reflection and administrative tasks

### ADD Optimizations
- Maximum 90-minute blocks to prevent overwhelm
- Clear transitions between different types of activities
- Variety in task types to maintain engagement throughout day
- Built-in reflection time to capture wins and plan improvements

### Key Metrics
- **Total Planned Hours**: 5.5
- **Deep Work Hours**: 3.0
- **Learning Hours**: 2.0
- **Admin/Reflection**: 0.5

## üöÄ Next Steps

### To Start Execution:
```
/taskmaster-start
```

### Integration Points:
- Morning check-in before Block 1
- Noon check-in after Block 2  
- Evening check-in during Block 5

### Calendar Sync:
Time blocks can be synced to Google Calendar using MCP integration for reminder support and focus protection.

## üîß Bug Report: Fractal Planner Issue

**Issue Identified**: The fractal-planner.cjs script uses interactive `readline` prompts, making it incompatible with LLM/CLI automation.

**Root Cause**: Script expects user input for each time block and objective via `await this.ask()` calls.

**Recommendation**: Create a non-interactive mode or separate LLM-friendly planning agent that can generate sensible defaults and accept structured input.
