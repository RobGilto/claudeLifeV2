- **Total Planned Time:** 5 hours (3h deep work, 1h learning, 1h admin)

## Next Steps

- **Execute plan:** `/taskmaster-start` to begin execution
- **Daily check-in:** Use `/morning-checkin` to track energy and set intentions
- **Track progress:** Update completion status throughout the day
- **Evening reflection:** Use `/evening-checkin` to review and plan tomorrow

## Integration Notes

- Plan syncs with daily check-in workflow for comprehensive tracking
- Victory detection will analyze technical progress and learning achievements
- Consider calendar sync with `/calendar-sync` for time blocking
