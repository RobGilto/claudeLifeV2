# Daily Plan: 2025-08-28

## Time Block Schedule (ADD-Optimized: 4 blocks)

### 09:00-10:30 | AI/ML Skill Development (1.5h)
**Focus**: Boot.dev or project work
- **Alignment**: Coding fundamentals and technical mastery
- **Energy Level**: High morning energy for complex learning
- **Output**: Measurable technical progress or completed lessons

### 11:00-12:00 | Communication & Admin (1h) 
**Focus**: Planning, admin, and communication tasks
- **Alignment**: Daily system maintenance and documentation
- **Energy Level**: Good for structured tasks
- **Output**: Clear inbox, updated systems, documented progress

### 14:00-15:30 | Technical Project Work (1.5h)
**Focus**: Advanced learning or portfolio project development
- **Alignment**: Project-based learning for AI engineering goals
- **Energy Level**: Post-lunch focus for implementation
- **Output**: Concrete project progress or advanced skill practice

### 16:00-17:00 | Research & Documentation (1h)
**Focus**: Skill practice, research, or victory/learning capture
- **Alignment**: Knowledge consolidation and progress tracking
- **Energy Level**: Lower energy suitable for reflection
- **Output**: Documented learnings, research insights, or skill evidence

## Daily Objectives (Max 3 for Focus)

1. **Complete meaningful technical progress**
   - Advance Boot.dev coursework OR make measurable progress on portfolio project
   - Document specific learnings and code examples

2. **Document learnings and capture victories**
   - Use victory tracking system for technical breakthroughs
   - Update skill matrix with evidence from today's work

3. **Maintain momentum with ADD-friendly structure**
   - Follow time-boxed sessions with breaks
   - Use rabbit hole journal for tangential thoughts
   - End day with reflection and tomorrow preparation

## Parent Alignment Context
**Note**: Operating in standalone mode - no parent plans detected
- This plan focuses on foundational skill building
- Aligns with 2026 AI engineering transition goals
- Maintains ADD-optimized workflow patterns

## Success Metrics
- **Total Planned Time**: 5 hours (3h deep work, 1h learning, 1h admin)
- **Deep Work Blocks**: 2 focused sessions for maximum impact
- **Energy Management**: High-energy tasks scheduled for peak times
- **Documentation**: All learnings captured for future reference

## Integration Notes
- Use `/taskmaster-start` to begin execution
- Consider `/calendar-sync` to schedule blocks
- Victory detection throughout the day
- End with `/evening-checkin` for reflection
