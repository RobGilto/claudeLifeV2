## üîç Weekly Insights
1. ** Need to be very careful how I talk to children - was harsh with son thinking he lacked empathy with sister's condition, went overboard telling him off, could have communicated better. Want to increase training habits and walking incrementally, maybe tomorrow will wear the weighted vest
2. **
3. **
4. ** Actually enjoying tmux for organizing workspaces, looking forward to incorporating the rest of the Second Brain Neovim setup tomorrow
5. ** Got stuck in nvim configuration but made progress. Need to balance deep technical work with higher-level AI development goals. Recognizing the pattern of getting tunnel vision on low-value tasks is important self-awareness.

## üèÜ Accomplishments & Wins
1. Completed full 38,000 subscription completion successfully for Domo client
2. Pushed myself till 11pm even when energy was low - showed persistence
3. Created and appreciated 3 issues on the AIPortfolio CLI project github - first time planning features through GitHub issues
4. **Professional Engineering Approach**: Breaking the AIPortfolio project into GitHub issues shows the same systematic thinking you used for the 37,000-item processing solution
5. **Consistent Practice**: Continuing AI engineering work despite physical tiredness demonstrates the discipline pattern that helped you maintain habits even during difficult periods
6. Keep momentum up with AI engineering by building/testing
7. Continue technical growth and learning
8. Focus on income-generating skills development
9. Applied ADR (Architecture Decision Records) to implement Git feature - major technical milestone!
10. Spent quality time with kids before bedtime


*Plus 32 more accomplishments...*

## üöß Challenges & Obstacles
1. ** Physical health tiredness, willpower depletion especially arguing with kids, daughter has ADHD and boundary issues
2. **
3. ** Tiredness, but evening nap helped
4. ** Setting up nvim/tmux/sessionx and getting familiar with them
5. ** Life happens - getting tired, children distracting and causing stress, tunnel vision focusing on low value tasks
