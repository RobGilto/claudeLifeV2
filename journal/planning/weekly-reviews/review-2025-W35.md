# Weekly Review: Week 35, 2025

## Performance Summary
- Objectives completed: 3/7 (42.9%)
- Priorities addressed: 3/4
- Overall satisfaction: 7/10

## Objective Review
### ✅ Completed Objectives
**Boot.dev Daily Practice (3/7 days)**
- Wednesday: 1 hour Python - "refreshing" learning experience
- Thursday: 1 hour despite stress and tunnel vision issues
- Friday: 1 hour maintaining streak - noted as foundation building

**PARA System Infrastructure**
- Successfully reorganized Linux folders using PARA system
- Major organizational upgrade for managing complex information

**Terminal Workflow Mastery**
- Discovered terminal-based workflow as optimal ADD environment
- Successfully integrated tmux + sessionX for workspace organization
- Described as "life-changing workflow optimization"

### ⏳ Partially Completed  
**Tmux/Neovim Practice (Variable)**
- Strong progress on tmux/sessionX setup and familiarity
- Still working on full Second Brain Neovim integration
- Progress toward "living in the terminal" workflow

### ❌ Not Started
**AI Code Challenge Project**
- Zero progress on completing AI coding project
- Identified as requiring more Python fluency foundation first

**Vim Research (ThePrimeagen methodologies)**
- No specific research sessions documented
- May need to adjust priority given other discoveries

**Weekly Commit Target (0/5)**
- No AI code commits recorded this week
- Need to establish coding output rhythm

## Well-being Metrics
- Average energy level: 6/10
- Average focus quality: 6/10
- Week satisfaction: 7/10
- Best performance days: Wednesday (8/10), Friday (6/10)
- Challenging days: Thursday (4/10) - deployment bug stress, tunnel vision

## Weekly Insights
**Major Strategic Breakthrough**: Identified Python fluency as the bottleneck holding back AI engineering progress. Terminal workflow discovery provides optimal ADD work environment.

**Mimic Recognition Progress**: Active counter-narratives to inner critic ("I am not a fool, this is the mimic talking"). Developed loving relationship with inner critic as protective family member.

**Energy Management Formula**: Action creates energy rather than waiting for energy to act. Physical movement (dog walks) effective for breaking tunnel vision patterns.

## Accomplishments & Wins
**Technical Infrastructure**:
- PARA system implementation for information architecture
- Terminal workflow mastery (tmux + sessionX)
- 3-day Boot.dev Python learning streak established
- Professional development environment foundation

**Strategic Insights**:
- Python fluency identified as critical path bottleneck
- Terminal environment + ADD hyperfocus = optimal conditions
- Consistent daily practice over intensity approach validated

**Personal Growth**:
- Mimic recognition and counter-narrative techniques
- Healthy stress response patterns (rest when overwhelmed)
- Strategic self-care without abandoning goals

## Challenges & Obstacles
**Technical Stress**: Deployment bug on Thursday triggered tunnel vision and high stress levels. Successfully used dog walk and rest as recovery strategies.

**Energy Fluctuations**: Post-breakthrough adjustment pattern (8/10 → 4/10 → 6/10) shows healthy recovery but indicates need for sustainable pacing.

**Project Output**: Zero coding projects completed. Foundation building (Python, terminal mastery) taking precedence over deliverables.

## Parent Plan Alignment
### Monthly Goal Contribution
Strong alignment with August goals around rebuilding AI development confidence:
- Established sustainable daily practice rhythm
- Created optimal work environment for ADD brain
- Identified and addressing key skill bottleneck (Python)

### Quarterly Strategic Progress
Terminal workflow discovery and PARA system implementation provide strong foundation for Q3 AI engineering transition goals. Python fluency focus aligns with practical implementation skills priority.

## Performance Patterns
- Most productive time/day: Mornings before stress accumulates
- Energy optimization: Terminal environment reduces distractions, physical movement breaks tunnel vision
- Focus challenges: Deployment debugging triggers obsessive thinking patterns
- Workflow insights: "Living in the terminal" breakthrough provides sustainable work environment

## Adjustments for Next Week
1. **Maintain Boot.dev Streak**: Target 7/7 days to build Python fluency
2. **Limit Debugging Sessions**: Time-box technical problem solving to prevent tunnel vision
3. **Daily Terminal Practice**: Use tmux for familiar tasks to build confidence
4. **Energy Pattern Recognition**: Track when tunnel vision starts to develop preventive strategies

## Next Week Preparation
- Carry forward priorities: Complete first AI project (post-Python improvement)
- New focus areas: Second Brain Neovim setup integration
- Process improvements: Time-boxed technical sessions with mandatory breaks
- Energy management: Leverage family time as energy recharge rather than obstacles

## Victory Detection
**Infrastructure Victories**: PARA system, terminal mastery, tmux integration
**Learning Victories**: 3-day Python streak, strategic bottleneck identification
**Personal Victories**: Mimic recognition, healthy stress response patterns
**Strategic Victories**: Found optimal ADD work environment, identified critical skill gap

## Next Week Planning Recommendations
1. **Plan Week 36**: `/plan-week` with focus on:
   - Extending Boot.dev streak to 7/7 days
   - Completing first AI project with new Python confidence
   - Integrating Neovim into terminal workflow
   - Establishing coding output rhythm

2. **Daily Execution**: `/taskmaster-start` with terminal-based time blocks
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Track energy patterns around terminal vs GUI work
4. **Victory Tracking**: Continue documenting technical and strategic breakthroughs
