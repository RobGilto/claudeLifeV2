## 📝 Next Week Planning Guidance

### Objectives to Carry Forward
No objectives to carry forward - start fresh with new goals

### Suggested Weekly Theme
"Foundation Building - Establishing Consistent Practices"

### Core AI Development Focus
Based on your accomplishments and 2026 AI engineering goal:
- **Start an AI project** - Apply your learning to real code
- **Focus on implementation** - Less setup, more building
- **Document your progress** - Build portfolio evidence

### Recommended Priority Distribution
- **Critical (1-2):** AI project development and boot.dev practice
- **High (2-3):** Supporting objectives that enable AI development
- **Low/Complete:** Environment setup (tmux/vim) - mark as done if functional

⚠️ **Reduce total objectives** from 8 to 4-5 maximum for better focus
