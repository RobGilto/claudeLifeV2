# Brain Dump: Systematic Learning and Project Management

I need to purchase the or I need to order the linked tag system so that they can track my tolls and also I need to get the logging of the projects for the cloud code into the file based on that YouTube so that when a project fails I can actually do a post-mortem.

So yeah, these two are really important. I need to also look back into Timothy Kenny's Udemy course to see how I can utilize project management and as well as how I utilize the planning and previews.

I need to really look into trial and error and how to scaffold my learning with trial and error so that the project fails I can learn just like Edison with the lightboards learn about what the failed, what works and do it in a systematic way where the AI will create reports.

And I can actually start creating policy around the experience.
