# Brain Dump: Mission Vision

I think the most important thing for the Claude Life version 3 is going to be a file called Mission. Mission is an MD file. I'm going to be thinking of adding hooks so that you can't delete this file and you can't modify it. Mission is going to be a human written file which will be referenced in Claude.md. Mission will be in my own words a file that describes what's my mission in life, what I'm trying to achieve, what is sort of my highest value, that North Star where I can come to it and I can write down what the rate truly value. Claude is able to read it and understand my perspective but it can't modify it. So I think that's so important.
