# Brain Dump: Debugging Stress and Engineering Mindset

All right, so today was a stressful event, it started off well, I started to develop my planner, but then I got stuck in a bug and I went through the tunnel vision and it really stressed me out because I kept on trying to fix it with Z-Bug and I just couldn't, I kept on asking the AI agent and it said I completed, I tested it out, it didn't work, so I went through that stress today.

I ended up going for a walk, I ended up resting, sleeping, so yeah, I'm just really frustrated that I'm not able to code or I'm feeling helpless, you know, and I don't want to feel helpless, I want to tackle these things in a more professional way, instead of just going through the obsession and hammering my head and in a way that's not productive, not an engineer kind of mindset, I don't want to be a hack anymore, I want to think like an engineer.

But I'm just so overheated and stressed, I'm frustrated, I can do, I can be better, there's a good thing is I, although it's too lingering, although it's too lingering, I just, I yank myself out of it, just yank myself out, and I went for a walk, slept, came back to an hour of boot.dev and I'm here, so it's around, it's still early, it's around, it's not even nine yet, nine p.m, so I'm just, just worried, I don't want to burn myself out, I want to keep the momentum up, I want to finish, I want to do the next two hours, I want to finish strong, I don't want to, I don't want to, I don't want to, I think the, what is the right question to ask here?

It's the right question to ask here, I think I need to refactor the code, because it's a very, it's a very long file, my coding standards are horrible, my AI development standards are horrible.
