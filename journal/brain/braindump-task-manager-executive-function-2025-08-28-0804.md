# Brain Dump: Task Manager Executive Function

Yeah, so there's no way around it. We'll learn Python. We need to get good at Python if we want to become a software AI engineer.

That's why I got boot.dev and you know make it to keep the momentum do it every day.

I'm also very interested in the AI engineering school course, the one that I have.

And I also do that every day. I'm also interested in the cloud code and interested in the AI development.

I can do that every day.

I think if I give it my best shot a couple of hours, use cloud life system to task manage and to give me daily news.

That makes it a very dynamic, very powerful system. I'm going to be working on really need to think about how to use task warrior and sort of the task warriors manager, which is the sort of the executive function where they look at.

They look at my code base for the cloud life and a task manager will sort of be the executive functioning where they go.

This is where we're at. This is our skill level. This is what we need to do this week.

And then we talk with task warrior to start assigning tasks and it's kind of like a job posting for me where I can go to task warrior and see what can be done today.

And I just pick on that one and work on it. Obviously there's going to be task manager.

The task manager will also be well aware of the rituals that I have to perform every day.

That includes work and life. And as well as the rituals I have to perform every day, the foundational rituals, which includes the boot.dev, boot.dev work and the AI engineering school.

So there's components of ritual and task assignments. Not sure how the task manager will perform and what is going to be a cron job, a contact job that it analyzes and creates decisions.

But what I really interested in is I am really interested in having a weekly plan and review like Timothy Kenney system.

And because I have Timothy Kenney system of plan and review per week, I also can have it per month and per quarter and per year.

And that way, that way I can actually do executive functioning, planning and review. I can actually do that.

And if I can hook in systems where the system will recognize that certain days represents key moments.

For example, I am on the weekend and I do a daily check-in.

The system will allow me to do the daily check-in. However, it will notify me that I need to do the weekly check-in because it's a Saturday.

Obviously, someone noticed me twice. If I've done it on Saturday versus Sunday. But it's a good way to use hooks.

The same thing goes with the monthly check-in. So say a day that I come up and that day is a weekend Saturday or Sunday.

And it is falling under the idea of the month.

We can kick off the process where we need to do a monthly check-in.

And I just want the system to work that way and the system to start using executive planning that way.

And that way I can work with that. And this can scale up to yearly goals and monthly year goals.

And it will help me with my career, help me with my family and with my community eventually.
