# Brain Dump: Development Struggles

I know I'm meant to be optimistic but I feel like I am in an AI development desert full of the ruins of the past. So what I'm in by this is I am creating slowly but I'm not developing at full capacity. I've been focused on my cloud life too but haven't been created production ready applications yet and I'm still learning how to code and think code and thinking production or system thinking so I'm still not there yet.
