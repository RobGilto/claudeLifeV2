# Brain Dump: Boot.dev Momentum and AI Development Focus

Okay so we're starting to get into habit with boot.dev. I started to have a streak happening, three day streak which is good. I need to keep the momentum up, maybe one hour a day, maybe get some, maybe get the, maybe look at the gamified elements and use them and just keep that momentum going.

A bit of a concern that I'm having is also I'm using Claude Code for my claudeLife repo. What I'm noticing is I'm not doing the AI development as much as I can. My confidence has been shot a bit so I want to try to tackle, I want to try to tackle this week a bit of AI code. But I want to be able to use, use those rail guards you know, coding standard quality is kept, organization of 1000 folders and features are kept. I want to be able to make sure that I have a way of keeping those standards.

And also I would like to do more research on YouTube with regards to Vim and ThePrimeagen's advanced methodologies and obviously his course that I have. I want to get more into Neovim and tmux and session X. Just get used to it, get used to it and keep going at it until it's second nature. And use it as, made my sort of my way of putting an IDE and having a, and using my second brain.

Yeah so I think I really want to get back into the, I really want to get back into the coding AI space.
