# Brain Dump: Problem Decomposition Strategy

Today struggling with boot.dev problems - key insight: need to break problems into components both mentally AND physically.

## The Struggle
- Hitting walls with complex coding problems
- Feeling overwhelmed by multi-step solutions
- ADD brain getting tangled in the complexity

## The Insight
Break problems into components:
- **Mentally**: Identify discrete logical steps
- **Physically**: Actually separate the work into different spaces/files/sessions

## Implementation Ideas
- Use separate code files for each component
- Write out the mental model before coding
- Test each component independently
- One component per focused session

## Connection to ADD Management
This aligns with time-boxed work sessions and external executive function systems. Instead of trying to hold the entire problem in working memory, externalize the breakdown.

## Next Steps
- Try this approach on the current boot.dev problem
- Document what works for problem decomposition
- Build this into the daily coding practice routine
