# Brain Dump: Transcription Workflow

As a user, I want to be able to run a slash command with a couple of arguments of the taking in way file off using and then transcribing the details. Once the details are transcribed, they are saved in a specific folder, which is brain dump, which is brain dump date.md. In one set, transcribed on that file, I would like a analysis done on that file, which will be brain dump analysis that date.
