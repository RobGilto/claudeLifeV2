# Brain Dump: Feedback System

As part of the improvement system, I need a feature which is sort of a hook which injects a system response. The system response will ask the user to give feedback and it will give perhaps a specific code to add onto the response. The user will copy that code and then give the feedback and then we can collect that feedback for later version updates.
