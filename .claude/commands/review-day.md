# Daily Review

Conduct a daily reflection and performance review of completed time blocks and objectives.

## Process:

1. Read CLAUDE.md and current daily execution context.

2. **Detect Period Boundaries** (Multi-Scale Intelligence):
   - **Check if today is Sunday** (day of week = 0): Week-end reached
   - **Check if today is month-end**: Last day of current month
   - **Check if today is quarter-end**: March 31, June 30, Sept 30, or Dec 31  
   - **Check if today is year-end**: December 31
   - **Prepare cascade suggestions** based on all detected boundaries

3. Show daily execution summary:
   ```
   üìÖ Reviewing Day: YYYY-MM-DD (Sunday - Week End)
   üìä Multi-Index: Day X/365 | Week Y/7 | Month Z/31 | Quarter A/92
   ```

4. Load daily execution data and review completion status:
   ```bash
   node scripts/taskmaster.cjs summary [date]
   ```

5. If no execution data exists, run manual daily review process:

   Ask these reflection questions:
   - **Time Block Review**: How did each planned time block go? (1-10 effectiveness)
   - **Objective Completion**: Which daily objectives were completed?
   - **Energy Patterns**: How was your energy throughout the day? (morning/afternoon/evening)
   - **Focus Quality**: What was your average focus during work blocks? (1-10)
   - **Interruptions**: What disrupted your planned schedule?
   - **Wins & Accomplishments**: What did you achieve today (however small)?
   - **Challenges**: What obstacles did you face?
   - **Tomorrow's Priority**: What's most important for tomorrow?
   - **Alignment**: How well did today support your weekly/monthly goals?

6. Create daily review report in `journal/planning/daily-reviews/review-YYYY-MM-DD.md`:

   ```markdown
   ---
   date: YYYY-MM-DD
   type: daily-review
   completion_rate: XX%
   energy_average: X/10
   focus_average: X/10
   satisfaction: X/10
   ---

7. Integrate with victory detection - scan accomplishments for victories and append to `/victories/victories-YYYY-MM.md`.

8. **Period-Boundary Intelligence** (Multi-Scale Detection):
   Check for all applicable period boundaries and suggest reviews in logical cascade order:
   
   **A. Sunday (Week-End) Detection**:
   If today is Sunday, provide this message:
   
   ```
   üéâ Daily Review Complete - Week End Reached!
   
   üìä Since today is Sunday (the last day of the week), you now have a full collection of daily data points ready for strategic analysis.
   
   üèÜ **Step 1 - Weekly Review**: 
   Run `/review-week current` to conduct your weekly performance review and strategic planning session.
   
   **Why Weekly Reviews Matter**: 
   - Weekly reviews synthesize 7 days of execution data into actionable insights
   - Pattern recognition across the week reveals optimization opportunities  
   - Strategic adjustments for next week based on completed week's learning
   - Momentum maintenance through systematic reflection and planning
   ```
   
   **B. Month-End Detection**:
   If today is the last day of the month, add this message:
   
   ```
   üóìÔ∏è **Month-End Reached!**
   
   üìà You've completed a full month of data collection. After your weekly review, complete your monthly strategic assessment.
   
   üéØ **Step 2 - Monthly Review**: 
   After weekly review, run `/review-month current` to capture:
   - Monthly objective and milestone completion analysis
   - Victory pattern analysis across the entire month
   - Strategic insights for quarterly goal alignment
   - Performance trends and breakthrough identification
   - Financial and career progress assessment toward 2026 goals
   
   **Strategic Value**: Monthly reviews provide the big-picture context that enables effective quarterly planning.
   ```
   
   **C. Quarter-End Detection**:
   If today is the last day of the quarter (March 31, June 30, Sept 30, Dec 31), add this message:
   
   ```
   üéØ **Quarter-End Reached!**
   
   üöÄ You've completed a full quarter of strategic execution. This is your most important review opportunity.
   
   üèÜ **Step 3 - Quarterly Review**: 
   After weekly and monthly reviews, run `/review-quarter current` to assess:
   - Quarterly strategic priority achievement and impact
   - Major milestone completion and strategic progress
   - Long-term trend identification and pattern recognition
   - Vision alignment evaluation and strategic pivot opportunities
   - Comprehensive achievement synthesis across 3 months of work
   
   **Critical Importance**: Quarterly reviews enable you to:
   - Plan the next quarter with deep strategic insight
   - Adjust your 2026 AI engineering transition timeline
   - Optimize resource allocation based on proven performance patterns
   - Identify breakthrough opportunities for accelerated progress
   
   **Next Quarter Planning**: After quarterly review, use `/plan-quarter [next-quarter]` for strategic Q4 planning
   ```
   
   **D. Year-End Detection**:
   If today is December 31, add this message:
   
   ```
   üåü **Year-End Reached!**
   
   üéâ You've completed a full year of strategic transformation work!
   
   üèÜ **Step 4 - Annual Review**: 
   After all other reviews, run `/review-year current` for comprehensive assessment:
   - Annual transformation goal achievement evaluation
   - Strategic vision alignment and mission fulfillment assessment
   - Year-over-year growth analysis and breakthrough identification
   - Career transition progress toward 2026 AI engineering goals
   - Personal development and financial progress evaluation
   
   **Year Transition**: Annual reviews set the foundation for next year's strategic vision and planning
   ```

9. **Complete Cascade Example** (September 30, 2025 - Sunday + Month-End + Quarter-End):
   If today is Sunday + Month-End + Quarter-End, provide the complete sequence:
   
   ```
   üåü **Triple Boundary Confluence Detected!**
   
   üéØ Today is Sunday (week-end) + Month-end + Quarter-end - the perfect strategic review opportunity!
   
   **Complete Review Cascade Sequence**:
   
   **Step 1**: `/review-week current` (2025-W39)
   - Complete weekly execution analysis first
   - 7 days of tactical performance data
   
   **Step 2**: `/review-month current` (2025-09)  
   - Build on weekly insights for monthly strategic assessment
   - September's "Professional Demonstration and Market Positioning" theme evaluation
   
   **Step 3**: `/review-quarter current` (2025-Q3)
   - Synthesize 3 months of strategic progress
   - Critical Q3 ‚Üí Q4 transition analysis for career timeline
   
   **Step 4**: `/plan-quarter 2025-Q4`
   - Use all review insights to plan October-December strategic execution
   - Position for final quarter of AI engineering preparation before 2026
   
   **Why This Sequence Matters**:
   Your AI engineering transition by mid-2026 depends on systematic reflection and strategic planning. This triple confluence gives you unprecedented insight into:
   - What execution patterns drive breakthrough results
   - Which strategic approaches accelerate your technical competency development  
   - How to optimize Q4 for maximum career transition momentum
   
   **Time Investment**: ~2-3 hours total, but provides foundation for Q4 success
   ```

10. **Regular Day Completion** (Monday-Saturday):
    Provide standard next day planning suggestions:
    - Create tomorrow's plan: `/plan-day`
    - Check weekly progress: `/performance-dashboard`

Remember: Daily reviews create the foundation data. Period boundary detection triggers intelligent cascading review suggestions (daily ‚Üí weekly ‚Üí monthly ‚Üí quarterly ‚Üí yearly) to maximize strategic insight and planning effectiveness across all time scales.
