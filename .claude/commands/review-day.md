# Daily Review

Conduct a daily reflection and performance review of completed time blocks and objectives.

## Process:

1. Read CLAUDE.md and current daily execution context.

2. Show daily execution summary:
   ```
   ðŸ“… Reviewing Day: YYYY-MM-DD
   ðŸ“Š Multi-Index: Day X/365 | Week Y/7 | Month Z/31 | Quarter A/92
   ```

3. Load daily execution data and review completion status:
   ```bash
   node scripts/taskmaster.cjs summary [date]
   ```

4. If no execution data exists, run manual daily review process:

   Ask these reflection questions:
   - **Time Block Review**: How did each planned time block go? (1-10 effectiveness)
   - **Objective Completion**: Which daily objectives were completed?
   - **Energy Patterns**: How was your energy throughout the day? (morning/afternoon/evening)
   - **Focus Quality**: What was your average focus during work blocks? (1-10)
   - **Interruptions**: What disrupted your planned schedule?
   - **Wins & Accomplishments**: What did you achieve today (however small)?
   - **Challenges**: What obstacles did you face?
   - **Tomorrow's Priority**: What's most important for tomorrow?
   - **Alignment**: How well did today support your weekly/monthly goals?

5. Create daily review report in `journal/planning/daily-reviews/review-YYYY-MM-DD.md`:

   ```markdown
   ---
   date: YYYY-MM-DD
   type: daily-review
   completion_rate: XX%
   energy_average: X/10
   focus_average: X/10
   satisfaction: X/10
   ---

7. Provide next day planning suggestions:
   - Create tomorrow's plan: `/plan-day`
   - Check weekly progress: `/performance-dashboard`

Remember: Daily reviews feed insights into weekly reviews and help optimize future daily planning.
