# Performance Dashboard

Comprehensive performance overview across all fractal planning levels with recommendations.

## Process:

1. Read CLAUDE.md to understand user context and current strategic objectives.

2. Display dashboard context:
   ```
   ðŸ“Š Performance Dashboard - YYYY-MM-DD
   ðŸ“… Multi-Perspective Status Across All Planning Levels
   ðŸŽ¯ Strategic Alignment Assessment
   ```

3. Execute comprehensive performance analysis:
   ```bash
   node scripts/performance-analyzer.cjs dashboard
   ```

4. Generate expanded dashboard report in `journal/planning/dashboard-YYYY-MM-DD.md`:

   ```markdown
   ---
   date: YYYY-MM-DD
   type: performance-dashboard
   status: current
   ---

   # Performance Dashboard: YYYY-MM-DD

   ## Multi-Perspective Index Status
   [Current fractal position across all planning levels]

   ## Current Period Performance
   ### Today (Day Level)
   - Plan status: [Exists/Missing]
   - Execution progress: [X/Y blocks completed]
   - Alignment score: [X/10]

   ### This Week (Week Level)  
   - Plan status: [Active/Missing]
   - Objective progress: [X/Y completed]
   - Energy/focus trends: [X/10 average]

   ### This Month (Month Level)
   - Strategic progress: [X/Y objectives on track]
   - Milestone status: [X/Y achieved]
   - Monthly satisfaction: [X/10]

   ### This Quarter (Quarter Level)
   - Strategic initiative progress: [status summary]
   - Transformation advancement: [qualitative assessment]
   - Quarterly trajectory: [On track/Behind/Ahead]

   ### This Year (Year Level)
   - Mission fulfillment: [X/10]
   - Yearly goal progress: [percentage estimates]
   - Vision alignment: [assessment]

   ## Recent Performance Trends
   [Weekly completion rates, energy patterns, focus quality over recent periods]

   ## Performance Highlights
   [Best recent performances and what made them successful]

   ## Current Gaps & Recommendations
   [Missing plans, overdue reviews, strategic misalignment issues]

   ## Next Strategic Actions
   [Prioritized recommendations for immediate focus]
   ```

5. Analyze strategic alignment gaps and provide specific recommendations:
   - Missing plan creation commands
   - Overdue review completions  
   - Strategic misalignment indicators
   - Performance trend concerns

6. Strategic recommendations based on analysis:
   ```
   ðŸŽ¯ Immediate Actions Recommended:
   â€¢ [Highest priority action with command]
   â€¢ [Second priority action with command] 
   â€¢ [Third priority action with command]

   ðŸ“ˆ Performance Optimization:
   â€¢ [Specific improvement suggestion]
   â€¢ [Process enhancement recommendation]
   â€¢ [Strategic adjustment advice]
   ```

7. Integration with existing systems:
   - Connect with victory patterns for motivation during low periods
   - Integrate with daily/weekly check-in mood data
   - Reference skill development progress from existing systems

Remember: The performance dashboard provides a holistic view of fractal planning effectiveness and strategic alignment across all time horizons.
