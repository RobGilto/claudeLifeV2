# Quarterly Planning

Create or update a quarterly plan with strategic priorities and major initiatives aligned to yearly vision.

## Process:

1. Read CLAUDE.md and yearly planning context to understand transformation goals.

2. Load and display foundational context:
   ```
   ðŸ“ˆ Planning Quarter: YYYY-QX
   ðŸ“Š Context: Year YYYY
   ðŸŽ¯ Core Values: [from planning/foundation/values.json]
   ðŸŽ­ Key Roles: [from planning/foundation/roles.json] 
   âœ¨ Lifestyle Vision: [from planning/foundation/lifestyle-vision.json]
   ðŸ“‹ Yearly Vision Context:
   - Year Vision: [show from yearly plan if exists]
   - Year Priorities: [show strategic priorities from yearly plan]
   ```

3. Conduct Values Alignment Check:
   - Review each proposed priority against core values
   - Score alignment (1-5) for each value-priority combination
   - Identify potential values conflicts or gaps
   - Suggest adjustments to improve alignment

4. Execute quarterly planning:
   ```bash
   node scripts/fractal-planner.cjs plan-quarter [quarter]
   ```

5. Create comprehensive quarterly strategic plan in `journal/planning/quarterly-reviews/plan-YYYY-QX.md`:

   ```markdown
   ---
   date: YYYY-MM-DD
   quarter: YYYY-QX
   type: quarterly-plan
   status: active
   parent_plans: [year-id]
   ---
