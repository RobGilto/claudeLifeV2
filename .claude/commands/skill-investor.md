# Skill Investor Command

Identify highest ROI micro-skills based on market demand, current gaps, and development efficiency.

## Process:

1. **Market Analysis**:
   - Use Firecrawl MCP to research current AI engineering job requirements
   - Identify most in-demand skills with salary correlation
   - Cross-reference with your current skill gaps (target - current)
   - Calculate effort-to-impact ratios

2. **Enhanced Git Analysis Integration**:
   - Run enhanced-git-analysis.js to detect current micro-skill patterns
   - Identify skills you're already practicing but not tracking
   - Find high-frequency patterns that indicate natural aptitude
   - Detect missing professional patterns in your code

3. **ROI Matrix Calculation**:
   ```
   ROI = (Market_Demand_Score Ã— Impact_Multiplier) / (Current_Gap Ã— Learning_Curve)
   
   Market_Demand_Score: 1-10 based on job postings analysis
   Impact_Multiplier: How this micro-skill enables bigger skills
   Current_Gap: Target_Level - Current_Level
   Learning_Curve: Estimated hours to proficiency (ADD-adjusted)
   ```

4. **Micro-Skill Investment Opportunities**:
   
   **Tier 1 (Immediate ROI)**:
   - API error handling patterns (enables system_design + debugging)
   - Unit testing basics (universally required, shows professionalism)
   - Git commit message standards (demonstrates communication skills)
   - README documentation structure (showcases thinking process)

   **Tier 2 (Medium-term ROI)**:
   - Async/await mastery (modern JS requirement)
   - Database query patterns (enables data engineering skills)
   - Performance measurement (demonstrates optimization thinking)
   - Code review practices (shows collaboration maturity)

   **Tier 3 (Strategic ROI)**:
   - System design documentation (differentiates senior candidates)
   - Architecture decision records (shows strategic thinking)
   - Mentorship through code comments (leadership indicators)

5. **GitHub MCP Integration**:
   - Scan recent commits across all repositories for micro-skill evidence
   - Detect which high-ROI skills you're already demonstrating
   - Identify gaps where competitors likely excel
   - Track skill transfer between projects

6. **Investment Recommendations**:
   - **15-minute daily investments**: Micro-skills requiring minimal setup
   - **2-hour weekend projects**: Skills needing focused practice
   - **Portfolio integration**: How to showcase new micro-skills
