# Start of Day Check-in

A comprehensive, LLM-intelligent personal motivational brief designed to launch your day with clarity, energy, and strategic alignment. Provides a holistic overview of your personal world and sets up optimal daily execution.

## Usage
```bash
/start-of-day
```

## Process

### 1. **CRITICAL - Time and Context Foundation**
   - ALWAYS use `./scripts/sydney-time.sh checkin` to get current Sydney time
   - ALWAYS use `./scripts/sydney-time.sh date` for today's date
   - NEVER use MCP time tools (they return UTC, not Sydney time)
   - Establish time context for all subsequent recommendations

### 2. **Personal World Intelligence Gathering**
   Read and synthesize key personal context:
   ```
   Essential Context Sources:
   - CLAUDE.md (mission statement, current goals, user context)
   - /planning/data/week-[current-week].json (current week priorities)
   - /planning/data/month-[current-month].json (monthly objectives and theme)
   - /planning/data/quarter-[current-quarter].json (if exists - quarterly strategic focus)
   - /victories/victories-[current-month].md (recent wins for motivation)
   - /journal/daily/daily-[yesterday].md (yesterday's journal entry if exists)
   - Recent /planning/data/day-[recent].json files (execution patterns)
   ```

### 3. **Smart System Status Checks**
   Analyze completeness of personal systems:
   
   **A. Yesterday's Review Status**:
   ```
   Check for yesterday's completion:
   - Read /journal/planning/daily-reviews/review-[yesterday].md
   - If missing: Note "Yesterday's reflection is pending"
   - If exists: Extract key insights and satisfaction level
   ```
   
   **B. Today's Plan Status**:
   ```
   Check today's planning state:
   - Read /planning/data/day-[today].json
   - If missing: Flag for immediate planning
   - If exists: Load time blocks, objectives, and ritual schedule
   ```
   
   **C. Strategic Context Loading**:
   ```
   Load hierarchical planning context:
   - Current week objectives and priorities
   - Current month theme and key milestones
   - Quarter-level strategic focus (if in planning files)
   - Recent victory patterns for motivation building
   ```

### 4. **LLM-Intelligent Personal Brief Generation**
   Using gathered context, generate a warm, personalized morning brief:

   ```
   üåÖ **START OF DAY BRIEF** - [Today's Date] - [Current Time]
   
   Good morning! Let's launch your day with clarity and purpose.

   ```
   üéØ **IMMEDIATE ACTION NEEDED**

   ```
   üí≠ **REFLECTION OPPORTUNITY**
   
   Yesterday's review is pending. Consider running `/review-day [yesterday]` to:
   - Extract lessons from yesterday's execution
   - Maintain performance tracking continuity
   - Build on yesterday's wins and learning
   ```

### 6. **Smart Command Recommendations**
   Use intelligent recommender system for personalized next steps:
   ```
   ## üéØ Your Optimal Next Actions

   **Recommended Sequence**:

   2. [Second recommendation with tactical benefit]
   3. [Third recommendation for momentum building]
