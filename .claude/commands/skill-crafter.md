# Skill Crafter Command

Deep progression tracking and mastery development for existing strengths - the craftsman's journey to expertise.

## Process:

1. **Mastery Level Assessment**:
   - Identify skills at 30-60% (prime crafting zone)
   - Analyze consistency patterns in recent git diffs
   - Detect advanced technique usage vs basic patterns
   - Measure code quality evolution over time

2. **Crafting Opportunity Analysis**:
   - **Pattern Sophistication**: Evolution from basic to advanced patterns
   - **Architecture Thinking**: System-level vs component-level solutions
   - **Error Anticipation**: Proactive vs reactive problem-solving
   - **Performance Awareness**: Optimization considerations in code

3. **Depth vs Breadth Strategy**:
   ```
   Current Skills Analysis:
   ‚Ä¢ JavaScript (36%) ‚Üí 65% target - PRIME CRAFTING ZONE
   ‚Ä¢ SQL (47%) ‚Üí 70% target - ADVANCED PATTERNS READY  
   ‚Ä¢ Git/GitHub (45%) ‚Üí 75% target - WORKFLOW MASTERY
   ‚Ä¢ Debugging (41%) ‚Üí 70% target - SYSTEMATIC APPROACHES
   ```

4. **Enhanced Git Pattern Detection**:
   - **Beginner Patterns**: Basic implementations, copy-paste solutions
   - **Intermediate Patterns**: Consistent structure, error handling
   - **Advanced Patterns**: Architecture decisions, performance considerations
   - **Expert Patterns**: Framework creation, teaching through code

5. **Crafting Progression Tracks**:

   **JavaScript Crafting (36% ‚Üí 65%)**:
   - Phase 1: Master async/await patterns consistently
   - Phase 2: Implement functional programming patterns
   - Phase 3: Create reusable modules and abstractions
   - Phase 4: Optimize performance and memory usage
   - Evidence: Function complexity, abstraction levels, performance considerations

   **SQL Crafting (47% ‚Üí 70%)**:
   - Phase 1: Complex JOIN patterns and subqueries
   - Phase 2: Query optimization and indexing strategy
   - Phase 3: Stored procedures and advanced functions
   - Phase 4: Database design and schema evolution
   - Evidence: Query complexity, performance tuning, schema decisions

   **Debugging Crafting (41% ‚Üí 70%)**:
   - Phase 1: Systematic debugging approaches
   - Phase 2: Preventive coding (logging, assertions)
   - Phase 3: Performance debugging and profiling
   - Phase 4: Architecture debugging and system thinking
   - Evidence: Error handling sophistication, logging quality, testing depth

6. **GitHub MCP Deep Analysis**:
   - Track pattern evolution across commits
   - Measure code complexity growth over time
   - Detect teaching moments (helpful comments, documentation)
   - Identify architectural decision points

7. **Crafting Momentum Indicators**:
   - **Consistency Score**: Regular practice with increasing sophistication
   - **Innovation Index**: New patterns attempted vs repeated patterns
   - **Teaching Quotient**: Code that explains and guides others
   - **System Thinking**: Cross-component considerations in solutions

8. **Mastery Milestones**:
   - **Journeyman** (40-50%): Consistent execution, few errors
   - **Craftsman** (50-65%): Pattern recognition, architectural thinking
   - **Master** (65-80%): Innovation, teaching, system-level impact
   - **Artisan** (80%+): Framework creation, mentorship, industry contribution
