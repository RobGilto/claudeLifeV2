# Calendar Sync

Convert daily time blocks from fractal planning into Google Calendar events using the MCP Google Calendar integration.

## Process:

1. First check that daily plan exists and load time block data:
   ```bash
   node scripts/calendar-sync.cjs [date]
   ```

2. For each time block in the daily plan, use the MCP Google Calendar integration to create events with these properties:
   - **calendarId**: "primary"
   - **summary**: "{activity} - Fractal Plan"
   - **description**: Include alignment, type, duration, and "Generated by Fractal Planning System"
   - **start**: ISO datetime string (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS)
   - **end**: ISO datetime string (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS) 
   - **timeZone**: "Australia/Sydney"
   - **reminders**: Popup at 10 minutes and 2 minutes before
   - **colorId**: Based on block type (deep-work=blue=1, learning=green=2, admin=orange=6, review=purple=3)

3. Use the MCP google-calendar create_event tool directly with the parameters from the script output.

4. Confirm successful creation and provide summary of synced events.

## Example Usage:
```
/calendar-sync 2025-08-28
```

## Notes:
- Requires Google Calendar MCP server to be configured
- Works with Australia/Sydney timezone
- Automatically handles duplicate detection based on start time and activity
- Saves sync data to planning/analytics/ for tracking
