# Smart Command Recommender

Intelligently suggests the most appropriate slash commands based on time of day, strategic periods, and conversation context. Uses cached command data for comprehensive analysis and scoring.

## Usage
```bash
/recommend [context]         # Get smart recommendations with optional context
/recommend --update [context] # Force update command cache before recommending
```

## Features
- **Intelligent Caching**: Automatically builds and maintains command metadata cache
- **Context-Aware Scoring**: Scores commands based on timing, user patterns, and missing activities
- **Strategic Period Detection**: Automatically detects year-end, quarter-end, month-end periods
- **Missing Activity Detection**: Identifies gaps in daily routines and suggests corrections
- **Mission Alignment**: All recommendations align with AI engineering transformation goals

## Process

### 1. Command Cache System
```bash
# Build command cache (automatic)
node scripts/command-cache-builder.js build

# Check cache status
node scripts/command-cache-builder.js check

# View cache statistics
node scripts/command-cache-builder.js stats
```

**Cache contains:**
- Command metadata (name, description, category, priority)
- Timing conditions (time of day, day of week, strategic periods)
- Context triggers (keywords, situations, missing activities)
- Integration points and prerequisites
- Output files and data flows

### 2. Intelligent Scoring Algorithm
```bash
# Generate recommendations with scoring
node scripts/intelligent-recommender.js [context]

# Force cache update and recommend
node scripts/intelligent-recommender.js --update [context]
```

**Scoring factors:**
- **Base Priority** (50-100): Command importance level
- **Time Matching** (+25): Perfect time-of-day alignment
- **Day Matching** (+20): Ideal day-of-week alignment
- **Strategic Periods** (+30): Quarter/month/year-end bonuses
- **Missing Activities** (+40/25/15): High/medium/low urgency gaps
- **Context Keywords** (+15): Input keyword matching
- **Category Boosts** (+20/15/10): Time-appropriate categories

### 3. Time and Context Analysis
```bash
# Get current Sydney time and date context
./scripts/sydney-time.sh checkin  # Current time
./scripts/sydney-time.sh date     # Current date
```

Analyze:
- **Current time of day** (early morning, morning, afternoon, evening, night)
- **Day of week** (Sunday for weekly planning, Monday for fresh starts, etc.)
- **Strategic periods** (month-end, quarter-end, year-end detection)
- **Calendar context** from conversation history
- **Recent activity patterns** from journal entries and planning data
- **Missing activities** (no checkins, no plans, gaps in routines)
- **User context** (Boot.dev streaks, task patterns, skill development)
