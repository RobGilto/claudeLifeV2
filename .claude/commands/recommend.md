# Smart Command Recommender

Intelligently suggests the most appropriate slash commands based on time of day, strategic periods, and conversation context. Purely informative - provides smart suggestions without taking any actions.

## Usage
```bash
/recommend [context]
```

## Process

### 1. Time and Context Analysis
```bash
# Get current Sydney time and date context
./scripts/sydney-time.sh checkin  # Current time
./scripts/sydney-time.sh date     # Current date
```

Analyze:
- **Current time of day** (early morning, morning, afternoon, evening, night)
- **Day of week** (Sunday for weekly planning, Monday for fresh starts, etc.)
- **Strategic periods** (month-end, quarter-end, year-end detection)
- **Calendar context** from conversation history
- **Recent activity patterns** from journal entries and planning data
