# Task Advisor

## Purpose
Provides intelligent, human-in-the-loop task management advice by analyzing your current context, rituals, and goals. Suggests tasks to create manually rather than automating task creation.

## Workflow
1. **Context Analysis**: Reviews current time, rituals, calendar, and existing tasks
2. **Smart Suggestions**: Provides specific task recommendations with reasoning
3. **Manual Creation**: You manually create suggested tasks using provided commands
4. **Progress Tracking**: Monitors task completion patterns for future advice

## Implementation

### Initial Context Gathering
```javascript
// Get current time and context
const currentTime = await getCurrentSydneyTime();
const ritualStatus = await getRitualStatus();
const existingTasks = await getNextTasks();
const calendarEvents = await getTodaysCalendarEvents();
```

### Advisory Analysis
- **Ritual Gaps**: Identify missing ritual tasks for today
- **Time Blocks**: Suggest tasks that fit available time windows
- **Priority Balance**: Recommend task priorities based on current workload
- **Project Focus**: Suggest project-specific tasks based on goals

### Suggestion Format
```
üéØ TASK RECOMMENDATIONS - [Current Time]

üìÖ Based on your rituals and calendar:
‚Ä¢ [Ritual/time block] - Suggested task with reasoning
‚Ä¢ Manual command: task add "description" project:X priority:H due:today

‚ö° Quick wins available (15-30 min):
‚Ä¢ [Specific actionable tasks]

üî• Priority focus areas:
‚Ä¢ [AI engineering skills] - Progress toward 2026 goal
‚Ä¢ [Financial automation] - Immediate financial impact

‚è∞ Time-sensitive items:
‚Ä¢ [Items with deadlines or optimal timing]

üí° Energy-appropriate tasks:
‚Ä¢ Morning: [High cognitive load tasks]
‚Ä¢ Afternoon: [Moderate focus tasks]  
‚Ä¢ Evening: [Administrative/review tasks]
```

### Human Commands Provided
For each suggestion, provide exact TaskWarrior commands:
```bash
# High priority AI learning
task add "Boot.dev Python fundamentals - 1 hour" project:Learning.AI priority:H due:today scheduled:today

# Ritual completion
task add "Morning reflection journal" project:Personal.Rituals priority:M due:today

# Project advancement  
task add "Portfolio project - RuneQuest character generator" project:Portfolio.AI priority:H
```
