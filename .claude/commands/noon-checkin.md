# Noon Check-in

A mid-day energy and planning checkpoint.

## Process:

1. First, understand the user's context by reading CLAUDE.md or any personal/business files to personalize the greeting and understand their work.

2. **Check Calendar and Planning Context**:
   - Read `/planning/data/day-YYYY-MM-DD.json` to get today's time blocks and objectives
   - Use MCP TaskWarrior to get current tasks: `mcp__taskwarrior__get_next_tasks`
   - Identify afternoon time blocks (after current time)
   - Note any calendar events or commitments

3. Check if `/journal/daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md` exists:
   - If exists: Read current content to see if noon session already completed
   - If noon session exists: Acknowledge and offer to update
   - If not exists: Create new file structure

4. Greet them warmly with context-aware questions:

ðŸŒ… **Noon Check-in for [Today's Date] - [Current Time]**

Good afternoon! Let's check your mid-day momentum:

**ðŸ“… Today's Afternoon Plan:**
[List upcoming time blocks and objectives from planning data]

**ðŸ“‹ TaskWarrior Status:**
[Show relevant pending tasks]

**Check-in Questions:**
1. **Morning energy level:** (1-10 + brief description)
2. **How did you sleep last night?** (quality/hours)
3. **What are your top 3 priorities for this afternoon?** (Reference planned time blocks)
4. **Any morning wins already?** (however small)
5. **Current focus/energy challenges?**
6. **What's working well so far today?**
7. **How do you feel about your afternoon plan?** (realistic/overwhelming/energizing)
8. Anything else to talk about?

5. Save/append to `/journal/daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md` with structure:
   ```yaml
   ---
   date: YYYY-MM-DD
   type: daily
   sessions: [noon]
   status: ongoing
   privacy: private

6. **Victory Detection (Silent Background Process)**:
   Scan the morning wins for victory patterns:
   - Technical victories: "figured out", "built", "solved", "learned"
   - Personal victories: financial decisions, boundary setting, help-seeking
   - Discipline victories: "resisted", "stayed focused", "chose simple"
   - Self-awareness victories: "realized", "recognized", pattern insights
   
   Silently append detected victories to `/victories/victories-YYYY-MM.md` using the established format.

7. NO full analysis yet - save that for evening when both sessions combine.

8. **Context-Aware Encouragement**: 
   - Reference specific afternoon time blocks
   - Acknowledge any potential energy/challenge alignment
   - Simple encouragement: "Great momentum! Your afternoon plan looks [realistic/energizing]. See you this evening for reflection."

Remember: Be encouraging, empathetic, calendar-aware, and focus on maintaining mid-day energy with realistic afternoon expectations.
