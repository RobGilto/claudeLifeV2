# Quarterly Review

Strategic quarterly assessment with major initiative evaluation and yearly vision alignment.

## Process:

1. Read CLAUDE.md and quarterly strategic context to understand major initiatives and priorities.

2. Display quarterly review context:
   ```
   üìà Reviewing Quarter: YYYY-QX
   üìä Strategic Period: [Q1/Q2/Q3/Q4] YYYY
   üéØ Yearly Vision Context: [connection to annual goals]
   ```

3. Execute interactive quarterly review:
   ```bash
   node scripts/fractal-planner.cjs review-quarter [quarter]
   ```

4. Create comprehensive quarterly strategic review in `journal/planning/quarterly-reviews/review-YYYY-QX.md`:

   ```markdown

   date: YYYY-MM-DD
   quarter: YYYY-QX
   type: quarterly-review
   completion_rate: XX.X%
   strategic_impact: X/10
   transformation_progress: X/10
   satisfaction: X/10
   ---
