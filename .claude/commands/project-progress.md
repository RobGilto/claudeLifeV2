# TaskWarrior Project Progress Analysis

Generate comprehensive progress analysis with completion metrics, trend analysis, and strategic recommendations for project advancement.

## Process:

1. **Identify Project for Analysis**:
   ```
   🎯 Specify project:
   • Project UUID (from creation)
   • Project name or identifier
   • TaskWarrior project hierarchy (e.g., "portfolio.showcase")
   ```

2. **Execute Progress Analysis**:
   ```bash
   node scripts/taskwarrior-project-manager.js project-view [project-uuid] --analysis
   ```

3. **Review Multi-Dimensional Progress**:
   ```
   📊 Analyze progress across multiple dimensions:
   • Task completion rates and velocity
   • Time investment vs. estimated hours
   • Milestone progression and deadline alignment
   • Quality indicators and technical debt
   • Strategic alignment with 2026 AI engineer goals
   ```

└── 🟢 Scope Risk: LOW (MVP well-defined)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════

📈 PRODUCTIVITY INSIGHTS:

High-Performance Patterns:
├── ✅ Morning deep work (9-11 AM): 85% task completion
├── ✅ 90-minute time blocks: 40% more effective than 2+ hour blocks
├── ✅ API/Backend tasks: 130% efficiency rate
└── ✅ Clear prerequisites: 90% first-attempt success

Optimization Opportunities:
├── 📋 Frontend tasks taking 20% longer than estimated
├── 🎯 Context switching reduces efficiency by 35%
├── ⚡ Momentum builds after 3+ consecutive days
└── 🧠 Documentation tasks best in afternoon (2-4 PM)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════

🚀 STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT:

2026 AI Engineer Transformation:
├── ✅ Full-stack skills: Advanced (React, Node.js, APIs)
├── ✅ Modern deployment: Intermediate (containers, CI/CD)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════

⚡ RECOMMENDATIONS:

Immediate Actions (Next 7 days):
1. 🎯 Focus morning blocks on frontend completion
2. 📋 Start testing framework setup (prevent last-minute rush)
3. 🔄 Maintain current momentum - 2+ hour daily minimum
4. 📅 Schedule deployment preparation for week 3

Strategic Optimizations:
├── 🧠 Batch similar tasks (all API work, then all frontend)
├── ⏱️ Leverage high-energy morning slots for complex problems
├── 📝 Document architecture decisions for portfolio presentation
└── 🎯 Plan AI enhancement phase for post-MVP showcase

Time Block Scheduling Priority:
1. Character creation UI completion (HIGH)
2. Testing framework setup (MEDIUM-HIGH)  
3. Production deployment preparation (MEDIUM)
4. Documentation and portfolio preparation (LOW-MEDIUM)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════

📅 NEXT ACTIONS:

Tomorrow's Recommended Schedule:
├── 9:00-10:30: Complete character form validation (1.5h)
├── 11:00-12:30: Build character display components (1.5h)  
├── 2:00-3:00: Set up Jest testing framework (1h)
└── 7:00-8:00: Update project documentation (1h)

Weekly Goal: Complete MVP core functionality (95% done)
Monthly Goal: Launch MVP and gather initial user feedback
