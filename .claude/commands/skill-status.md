# Skill Status Command

Current progress dashboard and gap analysis for your AI engineering journey.

## Process:

1. **Boot.dev Progress Tracking**:
   - Fetch live data from https://www.boot.dev/u/profusenegotiation88
   - Current XP level and lessons completed
   - Recent achievements and activity heatmap
   - Course completion analysis vs AI engineering requirements
   - Streak analysis from boot.dev activity

2. **Progress Dashboard**:
   - Visual progress bars for each skill category
   - Days until 2026 target date
   - Current vs target percentages
   - Weekly momentum indicators from boot.dev + GitHub

3. **Priority Matrix**:
   - **Critical Path**: Skills blocking 2026 goal
   - **Quick Wins**: High-impact, achievable improvements  
   - **Maintenance**: Skills at target that need practice
   - **Backlog**: Lower priority skills

4. **GitHub Activity Analysis**:
   - Recent commits across all repos using GitHub MCP
   - Language usage trends (Python, TypeScript, JavaScript)
   - Project complexity growth over time
   - Skill evidence from recent work

5. **Boot.dev Course Recommendations**:
   - Next courses to prioritize for AI engineering
   - Estimated completion times based on current pace
   - AI-specific course suggestions (Build AI Agent, etc.)
   - Portfolio project alignment with 2026 goals

6. **Weekly Trajectory**:
   - Improvement velocity per skill
   - Practice time effectiveness from boot.dev + GitHub
   - Skills at risk of decay (unused >4 weeks)
   - Projected completion dates

7. **Context-Aware Recommendations**:
   - Based on recent GitHub + boot.dev activity
   - Aligned with current projects (RuneQuest, AI Portfolio Manager)
   - Considers ADD-friendly practice patterns
   - 2-hour session breakdowns

8. **Streak Tracking**:
   - Boot.dev coding streaks and achievements
   - GitHub commit streaks by skill area
   - Victory pattern correlation
   - Momentum preservation strategies
