# Skill Status Command

Current progress dashboard and gap analysis for your AI engineering journey.

## Process:

1. **Progress Dashboard**:
   - Visual progress bars for each skill category
   - Days until 2026 target date
   - Current vs target percentages
   - Weekly momentum indicators

2. **Priority Matrix**:
   - **Critical Path**: Skills blocking 2026 goal
   - **Quick Wins**: High-impact, achievable improvements  
   - **Maintenance**: Skills at target that need practice
   - **Backlog**: Lower priority skills

3. **GitHub Activity Analysis**:
   - Recent commits across all repos using GitHub MCP
   - Language usage trends (Python, TypeScript, JavaScript)
   - Project complexity growth over time
   - Skill evidence from recent work

4. **Weekly Trajectory**:
   - Improvement velocity per skill
   - Practice time effectiveness
   - Skills at risk of decay (unused >4 weeks)
   - Projected completion dates

5. **Context-Aware Recommendations**:
   - Based on recent GitHub activity
   - Aligned with current projects (RuneQuest, AI Portfolio Manager)
   - Considers ADD-friendly practice patterns
   - 2-hour session breakdowns

6. **Streak Tracking**:
   - Consecutive days of skill practice
   - GitHub commit streaks by skill area
   - Victory pattern correlation
   - Momentum preservation strategies
