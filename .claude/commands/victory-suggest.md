# Victory Suggest Command

AI-powered victory detection from your journal entries and activities.

## Purpose
Catch victories you naturally dismiss or overlook, especially during the Mimic's active periods.

## Detection Patterns
Scans recent journal entries for:

### **Technical Victories**
- "I figured out...", "I built...", "I solved..."
- Git commits with meaningful changes
- Learning breakthroughs and "aha" moments
- System design insights

### **Personal Victories** 
- Financial decisions (like HECS payoff)
- Boundary setting with family/work
- Self-care choices during stress
- Seeking help when overwhelmed

### **Discipline Victories**
- Resisting scope creep or "while we're here" features
- Choosing simple over complex solutions
- Time-boxing sessions successfully
- Staying focused despite distractions

### **Self-Awareness Victories**
- Recognizing the Mimic's voice
- Pattern recognition about your own behavior
- Honest self-reflection moments
- Reframing negative situations positively

## Process
1. **Scan Sources**: Daily checkins, brain dumps, recent commits
2. **Pattern Match**: Apply victory detection algorithms
3. **Present Suggestions**: "I noticed you [accomplished X]. Worth celebrating?"
4. **One-Click Add**: Easy integration with add-victory command
