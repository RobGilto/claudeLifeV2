# Victory Review Command

Weekly victory reading system to build momentum and counter negative thinking.

## Purpose
Combat the Mimic's tendency to minimize wins by regularly surfacing and celebrating victories.

## Process

2. **Pattern Recognition**: "This week's victories show you're strong at [X]"
3. **Mood Boost**: Present victories in encouraging, celebratory format
4. **Reflection Prompts**:
   - What patterns do you see in these victories?
   - Which victory surprised you most?
   - What conditions enabled these wins?
   - How can you create more of these conditions?
