Background on Robert - AI Engineering Journey & Life Transformation
Personal Profile
My name is Robert, 41 years old, with two years of experience in Domo Technical Support (SaaS). I am an aspiring AI engineer with deep interest in AI-powered software development and personal automation. My ultimate goal is to become an AI software engineer by mid-2026.
I have attention deficit disorder (ADD), which presents challenges like impulse purchasing and a tendency to hyper-focus like a "bloodhound" on topics of interest. However, I've learned to leverage this by using my enduring fascination with RuneQuest TTRPG and Glorantha lore as scaffolding to learn new skills. This interest has been the basis for past projects, such as building solo VTT applications, and now serves as the foundation for my career transition and financial transformation.
Financial Reality & Motivation
This career change is part of a larger life transformation. I currently have no savings and carry a $1 million home mortgage. At 41, this isn't a barrier but a powerful motivation to turn my life around, building a healthier relationship with money while managing essential AI-related expenses. I'm building a resilient, AI-powered system that supports both personal and professional growth.
The Integrated Path - My Hybrid ADD-Optimized Approach
Core Learning Infrastructure

AI Engineer Launchpad community by Zen van Riel
Ray Fernando's group for external guidance and accountability
Claude Code Max and Pro plans (protected budget line - career investment)
Linux development environment with dedicated AIPortfolio folder

Sustainable Workflow Management
Reframing from "grind daily" to "consistent daily practice with deliberate rest":

Time-boxed deep dives: 4-hour maximum sessions with hard stops
"Rabbit hole journal": Capture tangential thoughts and purchase impulses for later
External executive function systems: Building AI tools to compensate for ADD challenges
RuneQuest lens: Frame AI concepts through familiar territory

Four Pillars of Development
1. Coding Fundamentals

Daily practice reading and understanding AI-generated code
Focus on pattern recognition over syntax memorization
Structured learning resources (FreeCodeCamp, community courses)
Ask Claude to explain code sections line-by-line
Build toward producing high-quality, low-debt, enterprise-grade code

2. Project-Based Learning (RuneQuest Universe)
Creating engaging, portfolio-building projects with monetization potential:

AI lore generator - potential Patreon/subscription product
Campaign organizer - SaaS for GMs
Solo adventure generator - DriveThruRPG sales opportunity
VTT applications with AI integration - freelance opportunities

3. Financial Automation & AI Integration
Applying AI engineering directly to personal finance:

AI-powered personal finance dashboard (first project)

Analyze spending patterns
Manage impulse purchases
Automate savings strategies
Explore financial literacy concepts


Building "external executive function systems" for money management
Transform ADD challenges into automated solutions

4. Technical Mastery Path
Incremental skill evolution:

Start with basic GitHub practices â†’ complex workflows
Master Claude hooks, commands, prompt/context engineering
Build toward GitHub Actions and enterprise architecture
Focus on upgradable, maintainable code patterns

Daily Practice Structure
Morning (90 mins) - Peak Energy

30-60 mins structured learning
10-15 mins code reading exercises
Review financial dashboard alerts

Midday - Project Work

RuneQuest-themed development
Active rabbit hole journal
Note purchase impulses without acting

Evening (15 mins) - Integration

Document learnings
Quick finance check
Update progress metrics

Weekly Rhythm

Mon/Wed/Fri: Strategic learning (fundamentals, structured courses)
Tue/Thu: Creative project work (monetizable RuneQuest AI tools)
Saturday: Integration (documentation, GitHub updates, financial review)
Sunday: Rest or hyperfocus "free play"

Incremental Tool Development Roadmap
Phase 1: Foundation (Q1 2025)

Basic Python break reminder

Key Principles

Every project has monetization potential while learning
AI fees are protected investments, not expenses
Impulse purchases get journaled, not executed
Document everything - the journey has value to others
Financial health IS mental health - integrated approach
Age is motivation, not limitation - urgency drives focus

Current Status & Mindset
At 41, with financial pressure but powerful motivation, I'm not just changing careers - I'm optimizing my entire life. I've already succeeded in maintaining a tech support role for 2 years while managing ADD. Now I'm leveraging my hyperfocus as a strength, using RuneQuest as scaffolding, and building AI-powered systems for both technical mastery and financial security.
My age and financial situation aren't barriers - they're the fuel for building a resilient, AI-powered system that transforms both my career and financial future. By mid-2026, I'll be an AI software engineer with improving financial stability, working WITH my brain's unique wiring rather than against it.
This is my turning point. This is my year of transformation.
