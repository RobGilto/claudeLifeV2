Background on Robert - AI Engineering Journey & Life Transformation
Personal Profile
My name is Robert, 41 years old, with two years of experience in Domo Technical Support (SaaS). I am an aspiring AI engineer with deep interest in AI-powered software development and personal automation. My ultimate goal is to become an AI software engineer by mid-2026.
I have attention deficit disorder (ADD), which presents challenges like impulse purchasing and a tendency to hyper-focus like a "bloodhound" on topics of interest. However, I've learned to leverage this by using my enduring fascination with RuneQuest TTRPG and Glorantha lore as scaffolding to learn new skills. This interest has been the basis for past projects, such as building solo VTT applications, and now serves as the foundation for my career transition and financial transformation.
Financial Reality & Motivation
This career change is part of a larger life transformation. I currently have no savings and carry a $1 million home mortgage. At 41, this isn't a barrier but a powerful motivation to turn my life around, building a healthier relationship with money while managing essential AI-related expenses. I'm building a resilient, AI-powered system that supports both personal and professional growth.
