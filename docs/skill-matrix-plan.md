# AI Engineer Skill Matrix System - Implementation Plan

## Overview
A RuneQuest-inspired skill tracking system for Robert's journey from Technical Support to AI Engineer by mid-2026.

## Core Concept: BRP/RuneQuest Mechanics Applied to Tech Skills

### Skill System Philosophy
- **d100 System**: Each skill has a percentage (0-100%) representing competency
- **Experience Checks**: Skills improve through use, not just training
- **Realistic Progression**: Weekly checks prevent inflated skill claims
- **The Mimic Counter**: Track real evidence against imposter syndrome

## Skill Categories & Matrix

### 1. AI Engineering Core (Target: 70%+ by 2026)
```json
{
  "ai_fundamentals": {
    "current": 15,
    "target": 75,
    "subskills": {
      "llm_understanding": 20,
      "prompt_engineering": 35,
      "model_selection": 10,
      "fine_tuning": 5,

      "neural_networks": 10,
      "training_evaluation": 5,
      "embeddings": 15,
      "vector_databases": 20
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Software Engineering (Target: 60%+)
```json
{
  "programming": {
    "current": 25,
    "target": 65,
    "languages": {
      "python": 30,
      "javascript": 35,

    "testing": 15,
    "debugging": 30,
    "code_review": 20,
    "system_design": 10
  }
}
```

### 3. Technical Operations (Current Strength: 50%+)
```json
{
  "domo_expertise": 85,
  "api_integration": 60,
  "data_pipelines": 55,
  "troubleshooting": 70,
  "documentation": 65
}
```

### 4. Soft Skills & ADD Management
```json
{
  "focus_management": {
    "time_boxing": 40,
    "context_switching": 25,
    "rabbit_hole_control": 30
  },
  "communication": {
    "technical_writing": 55,
    "stakeholder_management": 45,
    "mentorship": 35
  }
}
```

## BRP-Inspired Progression System

### Experience Check Mechanism
1. **Weekly Roll**: For each skill used during the week
2. **Success Criteria**: Roll d100 > current skill level = improvement chance
3. **Improvement Rate**: 
   - Critical practice (daily): +1d6
   - Regular practice (3x/week): +1d3
   - Occasional practice (1x/week): +1

### Skill Improvement Formula
```javascript
function calculateSkillIncrease(currentSkill, practiceIntensity, successfulProjects) {
  const baseIncrease = practiceIntensity; // 1-6 based on frequency
  const bonusFromSuccess = successfulProjects * 0.5;
  const difficultyModifier = (100 - currentSkill) / 100; // Harder to improve at higher levels
  
  return Math.round((baseIncrease + bonusFromSuccess) * difficultyModifier);
}
```

## Implementation Architecture

### 1. Data Storage Structure
```
/skills/
├── skill-matrix.json          # Current skill levels
├── skill-history/             # Weekly snapshots
│   └── YYYY-WW.json
├── evidence/                  # Proof of skills
│   ├── projects.json
│   ├── certifications.json
│   └── code-samples.json
└── reviews/                   # Weekly self-assessments
    └── YYYY-WW.md
```

### 2. Automated Update Script
```javascript
// scripts/update-skills.js
const updateSkills = async () => {
  // 1. Fetch current week's activities from git commits
  // 2. Analyze daily checkins for skill usage
  // 3. Scan completed projects and victories
  // 4. Apply BRP experience check logic
  // 5. Update skill-matrix.json
  // 6. Generate weekly report
};
```

### 3. Weekly Cron Job
```bash
# Run every Sunday at 6 PM
0 18 * * 0 /usr/bin/node /home/robert/claudeRepos/claudeLifeV2/scripts/update-skills.js
```

## Honest Review System

### Anti-Inflation Measures
1. **Evidence Required**: Each skill claim needs proof
   - Git commits
   - Project completions
   - Code reviews
   - Problem-solving logs

2. **Reality Checks**:
   - Can't jump more than 10% in a single week
   - Skills decay without practice (-1% per month unused)
   - External validation bonus (peer review, production code)

3. **The Mimic Counter**:
   - Track imposter syndrome moments
   - Compare feelings vs. actual evidence
   - Build confidence through data

## Skill Assessment Criteria

### Levels Based on Percentage
- **0-20%**: Novice (following tutorials, basic understanding)
- **21-40%**: Advanced Beginner (can modify existing code)
- **41-60%**: Competent (can build features independently)
- **61-80%**: Proficient (can architect solutions)
- **81-95%**: Expert (can teach and innovate)
- **96-100%**: Master (industry recognized expertise)

## Weekly Review Protocol

### `/skill-review` Command Features
1. **Automatic Evidence Collection**:
   - Git activity analysis
   - Victory log scanning
   - Project completion tracking

2. **BRP Experience Checks**:
   - Roll for each practiced skill
   - Apply improvements based on intensity

3. **Progress Visualization**:
   - Current vs. Target charts
   - Weekly improvement trends
   - Skill heat map

4. **Next Week Planning**:
   - Identify skills needing focus
   - Suggest learning resources
   - Set practice goals

## Integration Points

### With Existing Systems
- **Daily Checkins**: Track which skills were practiced
- **Victory System**: Skills demonstrated in victories get bonus XP
- **Brain Dumps**: Analyze for learning patterns and skill application
- **Weekly Reviews**: Comprehensive skill assessment and planning

## Success Metrics

### 2024 Q4 Targets
- Python: 40% (from 30%)
- LLM Understanding: 30% (from 20%)
- RAG Implementation: 25% (from 15%)

### 2025 Milestones
- Q1: First AI project in production
- Q2: Contributing to open-source AI projects
- Q3: Building portfolio of AI applications
- Q4: Interview-ready for AI Engineer roles

### 2026 Goal
- Mid-year: AI Engineer position secured
- All core AI skills at 60%+ competency

## Next Steps

1. Create initial `skill-matrix.json` with current assessments
2. Build `update-skills.js` script with Firecrawl integration
3. Add skill tracking to daily/weekly checkin commands
4. Create `/skill-review` slash command
5. Set up weekly cron job for automated updates
6. Build visualization dashboard for progress tracking
