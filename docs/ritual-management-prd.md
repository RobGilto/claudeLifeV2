# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## Advanced Ritual Management System with Selective Calendar Sync

### **1. Executive Summary**

#### **1.1 Problem Statement**
Robert's current ritual management system lacks sophisticated scheduling patterns, UUID-based deduplication, and selective calendar synchronization. This creates calendar bloat, scheduling conflicts, and manual overhead in managing recurring commitments. The system needs to support complex frequency patterns (daily, every-other-day, weekly, monthly, quarterly) while only syncing to Google Calendar during active planning periods.

#### **1.2 Solution Overview**
An advanced ritual management system that maintains ritual definitions locally, supports complex scheduling patterns through rich CLI syntax, and selectively syncs rituals to Google Calendar only for actively planned periods (day, week, month, quarter, year).

#### **1.3 Strategic Alignment**
This system directly supports Robert's mission to become a Senior AI Software Engineer by mid-2026 through:
- **Protecting foundational learning blocks** (Boot.dev daily practice, AI engineering study)
- **Optimizing ADD workflow** with structured time management
- **Reducing cognitive overhead** through automated scheduling
- **Maintaining work-life balance** with flexible ritual management

### **2. Goals and Objectives**

#### **2.1 Primary Goals**
1. **Eliminate Calendar Bloat**: Only sync rituals for actively planned periods
2. **Support Complex Schedules**: Handle sophisticated frequency patterns (quarterly, monthly, bi-weekly, etc.)
3. **Prevent Duplication**: UUID-based architecture ensures no duplicate events across systems
4. **Maintain Single Source of Truth**: Ritual definitions stay in JSON, calendar is a view

#### **2.2 Success Metrics**
- **Zero duplicate events** across ritual system, calendar, and planning
- **100% ritual coverage** during planned periods (no missing ritual blocks)
- **< 30 second sync time** for any planning period
- **< 10% calendar conflicts** after implementation
- **80% reduction** in manual scheduling effort

### **3. User Stories**

#### **3.1 Core User Stories**

**As Robert, I want to:**
1. **Define complex rituals** using natural language commands so I can capture all my recurring commitments
2. **Sync rituals selectively** to calendar only when planning specific periods so my calendar isn't cluttered
3. **View ritual status** to understand my available time for any given day/week
4. **Track ritual completion** with streaks and metrics to maintain consistency
5. **Handle exceptions** with temporary blocks for appointments and one-off events
6. **Prevent conflicts** between rituals, planning blocks, and existing calendar events

#### **3.2 Detailed User Scenarios**

**Daily Planning Scenario:**
```
1. Robert runs `/plan-day --sync-rituals --hitl`
2. System loads ritual definitions for that day
3. Rituals are pushed to Google Calendar for that day only
4. Planning blocks fill remaining available windows
5. Robert approves the plan (HITL workflow)
6. Calendar is populated with both rituals and planning blocks
```

**Weekly Planning Scenario:**
```
1. Robert runs `/plan-week --sync-rituals`
2. System calculates all ritual instances for the week
3. Creates calendar events for work schedule (Mon-Fri) and daily rituals
4. Planning system generates weekly objectives around ritual constraints
5. Week view in calendar shows complete schedule
```

         ↓
Load Ritual Definitions for Period
         ↓
Check Existing Calendar Events
         ↓
Detect and Resolve Conflicts
         ↓
Create Calendar Events for Rituals
         ↓
