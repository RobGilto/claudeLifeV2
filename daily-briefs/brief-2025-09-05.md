## üöÄ PRIORITY CAREER INSIGHTS

### 1. Australian Salary Market Reality Check ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Source:** News.com.au (September 3, 2025) & SEEK Data

**Key Findings:**
- **$150,000 is now the most common minimum salary filter** used by Australian job seekers (13.6% of searches)
- $100,000 follows at 13.5% of searches
- **76% of Australians willing to return to office full-time for salary increase**
- Gen Z leading the charge at 86% willingness to trade flexibility for money

**Why This Matters for Robert:**
Your $300K Google story aligns with market reality - high-paying tech roles exist, but the broader market sees $150K as aspirational minimum. Your current Domo role likely undervalues your potential.

**Actionable Next Steps:**
- Set salary expectations at $120K-150K range for AI implementation roles
- Consider office-hybrid roles if they offer significant salary premiums
