# Daily Brief - August 26, 2025

**Today's Date:** Monday, August 26, 2025  
**News Period:** December 19-26, 2024 (Most Recent Week Available)

Based on your AI engineering goals, ADHD management systems, and career transition to mid-2026, here are the most relevant developments from the tech industry:

## üî• **Breaking: Free AI Coding Tools Now Available**

### GitHub Copilot Goes Free
**Published:** December 18, 2024

GitHub launched a free tier of Copilot with 2,000 code completions and 50 chat messages monthly, including access to Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4o models across VS Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and GitHub.com.

**Why this matters to you:** This removes the financial barrier ($10-20/month) to enterprise-level AI coding assistance - perfect for your $100/month tech budget constraint while building RuneQuest portfolio projects.

**Action:** Set up GitHub Copilot Free immediately for your daily Python coding practice and TypeScript RuneQuest tools development.

## üß† **ADHD-Friendly Career Opportunities**

### Goldman Sachs Neurodiversity Program Success
**Published:** December 2024 data

Goldman Sachs achieved 100% offer and acceptance rates for neurodivergent candidates (including ADHD) through their Specialisterne partnership program in 2024.

**Why this matters to you:** Demonstrates growing corporate recognition of ADHD as a strength in tech roles. Your systematic approach to building external executive function tools aligns perfectly with this trend.

**Action:** Monitor Specialisterne and similar organizations for 2025 neurodivergent hiring programs while building your AI portfolio.

## üöÄ **Australian AI Job Market Surge**

### 500% Growth Trajectory Through 2030
**Published:** December 2024 analysis

Australia's AI workforce grew from 800 (2014) to 33,000 (2023), with Sydney leading demand. Current salaries: Entry AUD $133K, Average AUD $152K, Senior AUD $177K.

**Why this matters to you:** Validates your mid-2026 timeline and income goals ($150K+ after-tax). The 500% growth needed by 2030 creates excellent opportunities for your career transition.

**Action:** Focus portfolio projects on high-demand areas: business analytics, financial automation, and AI agent development.

## üêç **Python Ecosystem Updates**

### Python 3.8 End of Life Transition
**Published:** December 2024

Python 3.8 reached end-of-life with major libraries (Flask 3.1.0, Ruff 0.8) dropping support. Python 3.14.0a2 released with new template strings (PEP 750).

**Why this matters to you:** Staying current with Python versions is crucial for AI engineering credibility. Your PyTorch AI projects need Python 3.9+.

**Action:** Audit all projects to ensure Python 3.9+ usage, especially for AI model training and Whisper transcription tools.

---

## üîó **Model Context Protocol (MCP) Adoption**

### Industry Standard Emerging
**Published:** December 2024

Following Anthropic's November MCP launch, December saw rapid adoption by Zed, Replit, Codeium, and Sourcegraph for standardized AI agent integration.

**Why this matters to you:** MCP knowledge could differentiate you in the AI engineering job market as it becomes the standard for AI tool integration.

**Action:** Learn MCP basics and build a portfolio demo - perhaps integrating AI agents with your brain dump analysis system.

## üí∞ **Personal Finance AI Mainstream**

### 67% of Gen Z Using AI for Finance
**Published:** December 2024

Mainstream adoption of AI financial tools (Apple Copilot, Albert, YNAB) showing $80-500 annual savings, validating the market for personal finance automation.

**Why this matters to you:** Perfect validation for your first major project idea: AI-powered personal finance dashboard addressing your mortgage pressure situation.

**Action:** Build this as a portfolio project combining Python, TypeScript, and AI - demonstrates both technical skills and market understanding.

---

## üìà **TypeScript Dominance Confirmed**

### 35% Developer Usage in 2024
**Published:** December 2024

TypeScript usage jumped from 12% (2017) to 35% (2024), identified as an "undisputed leader" alongside Python and Rust.

**Why this matters to you:** TypeScript is essential for full-stack AI applications. Your RuneQuest VTT tools and SaaS projects will need strong TypeScript skills.

**Action:** Prioritize TypeScript learning for building web interfaces for your AI applications, particularly RuneQuest campaign tools.

---

## üè¢ **Enterprise AI Modernization**

### 90% Commitment to AI-Driven Updates
**Published:** December 2024

90% of enterprises committing to AI modernization with agentic AI emerging as the frontier for autonomous "virtual coworkers" handling multistep workflows.

**Why this matters to you:** Your technical support background provides unique insight into enterprise pain points that agentic AI can solve.

**Action:** Focus learning on enterprise AI implementation and agentic systems - highly valued skills for your career transition.
