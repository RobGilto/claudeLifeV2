# Test Calendar Event Command

Copy and paste this exact command to test if the MCP integration works:

```
Use the Google Calendar MCP to create an event with these details:
- Calendar: primary
- Title: "ðŸ”§ TEST: Calendar Integration Working - Fractal Plan"
- Date: August 28, 2025
- Time: 4:30 PM - 4:45 PM Sydney time
- Description: "âœ… This event proves the calendar sync is working!\n\nCreated via fixed MCP integration\nType: testing\nGenerated by Fractal Planning System"
- Color: Yellow (colorId: 5)
- Reminders: 5 minutes before
```

Or if you want the raw MCP parameters:

```json
{
  "calendarId": "primary",
  "summary": "ðŸ”§ TEST: Calendar Integration Working - Fractal Plan",
  "description": "âœ… This event proves the calendar sync is working!\n\nCreated via fixed MCP integration\nType: testing\nGenerated by Fractal Planning System",
  "start": "2025-08-28T16:30:00",
  "end": "2025-08-28T16:45:00",
  "timeZone": "Australia/Sydney",
  "reminders": {
    "useDefault": false,
    "overrides": [{"method": "popup", "minutes": 5}]
  },
  "colorId": "5"
}
```

After running this, check your calendar at 4:30 PM today for a yellow test event.
